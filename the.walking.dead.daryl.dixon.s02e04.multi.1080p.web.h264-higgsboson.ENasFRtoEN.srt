Episode 1

2
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:03,800
Come on, let's go.

3
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,420
Not in the head.

4
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:32,790
Come on, let's go.

5
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,190
Come on, let's go.

6
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,570
Come on, come on.

7
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,610
Come on, come on.

8
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,390
This one.

9
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,150
The guy on the left.

10
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,070
Him, him, him.

11
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,130
Look.

12
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,410
Come on, shoot him.

13
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,450
Come on, let's go.

14
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,410
Yeah, yeah, okay.

15
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,430
He's still alive.

16
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,310
Look at the girl over there.

17
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,010
Yeah, she's moving.

18
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:57,650
He's moving.

19
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,520
They're all dead.

20
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,830
Ah.

21
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,130
No!

22
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,190
Stop it!

23
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,610
Shoot him!

24
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,670
Get us out of here.

25
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,910
Hurry up!

26
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,450
Go, go!

27
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,460
What are you doing?

28
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,260
Why are you stopping?

29
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:13,920
They're coming!

30
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,380
They're coming!

31
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,640
Over there ! Over there !

32
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,860
Shoot the mortar !

33
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,750
RUN !

34
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,180
Hold still !

35
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,950
Go on ! Up the mountain !

36
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,070
What about you ?

37
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,510
Tell Dixon I did it for the boy.

38
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,550
Come on ! Come on !

39
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,210
Come on ! I'm here !

40
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,160
I'm sorry we're getting there.

41
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,700
But you have to tell us where he is.

42
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,540
You made the choice.

43
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:12,350
When we first met,

44
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,050
Laurent was six.

45
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:17,850
I'd heard of him.

46
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,370
A child torn from the womb of an affamé.

47
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,590
From a horrific ending,

48
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,430
a miraculous beginning.

49
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,300
We met with the boy, we evaluated his gifts, we...

50
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,780
found him to be special.

51
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,520
As Père-Jean had said he would be,

52
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,020
as you said he would be.

53
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,980
For years, the good father and I stayed in touch as best we could,

54
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,300
and then when it seemed time, we summoned the boy here.

55
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,160
Time for you or time for him ?

56
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,300
Time for us all.

57
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,500
To be free again.

58
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,900
There was only one reason.

59
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,400
You feared losing control.

60
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,440
I can see that now.

61
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,240
I'm sorry your will is weakened.

62
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,880
I want to fortify you,

63
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,480
and everyone who's feeling tired and hopeless.

64
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,460
What you're doing is not strength,

65
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,520
Lausanne.

66
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,420
It's desperate, misguided, and it's savage.

67
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,140
It sounds like Daryl talking.

68
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:28,940
No, that's me.

69
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,680
The part of me that was asleep until I met him.

70
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,360
The part that doesn't believe in false prophets anymore.

71
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,520
You yourself said how special the boy was all those years ago.

72
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,220
He is special, he thinks and feels in a way that humanity needs

73
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,940
in order to survive.

74
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,840
But he's human.

75
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,800
He can bleed, he can be hurt.

76
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,500
He can die.

77
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,420
Like Jesus, like Mohammed, like Buddha.

78
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,420
This is a waste of time.

79
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,300
Stop it !

80
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,350
Sister,

81
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,330
we're going to offer the flock proof of their faith.

82
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,950
It must be done.

83
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,210
Do you understand ?

84
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,390
And so I need you to tell me where the boy is.

85
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,250
They're at the gate. They're on the way up.

86
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,710
The army of Jeunet is in the village.

87
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,790
Well, they're coming.

88
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,310
Lausanne !

89
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,750
We must go !

90
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,350
The soldiers are coming !

91
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,190
Come on !

92
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,700
Excuse !

93
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,680
Don't move !

94
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,400
Get back on the other side !

95
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,700
Cover me, let's go !

96
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:33,450
Are you all right ?

97
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,000
Were you stabbed ?

98
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,880
Sit down.

99
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,420
Just breathe.

100
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,260
Careful.

101
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,280
Have a look.

102
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,380
Looks pretty clean, that's good.

103
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,190
My name is Carol.

104
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,810
Easy now.

105
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,630
Keep that pressed pretty tight, okay ?

106
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,290
Can you do that for me ?

107
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,550
You're shivering.

108
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,090
What are you doing here ?

109
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,630
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

110
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,370
From America.

111
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:22,840
Come on !

112
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,690
She's right there.

113
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,850
No, no, no !

114
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,030
It's okay.

115
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,790
Shit !

116
00:14:59,390 --> 00:14:59,910
Here.

117
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,370
Hold this real tight.

118
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,690
We're getting out of here, come on !

119
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,650
No !

120
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,630
It's too late.

121
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,350
It's not too late.

122
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:11,850
Not like this.

123
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,340
Just make sure he's okay.

124
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,920
We can do that together.

125
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,330
Make sure he's taken care of.

126
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,500
That he knows I'm always with him.

127
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,400
Okay ?

128
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:51,800
Okay.

129
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,400
Okay.

130
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,740
I can see them.

131
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,640
The fireflies.

132
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,060
They're so beautiful.

133
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,720
Come on, move faster.

134
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,600
Where are we going ?

135
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,080
Let's go.

136
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,080
Hey.

137
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,050
You know, I got somebody ready to take us home.

138
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,270
The pilot of the plane back in Paris.

139
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,579
Everybody misses you.

140
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,839
Connie, Judith, they'll all be so happy to have you come back.

141
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,780
Are you hearing me ?

142
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,859
You knew her before, didn't you ?

143
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,280
She's doing pretty well, I know.

144
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,960
Who is she talking about taking care of ?

145
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,860
This way.

146
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,670
It's over.

147
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:45,970
Give up.

148
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,450
The night is ours.

149
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,330
What ?

150
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,240
They're gone.

151
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,940
Who's gone ?

152
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,540
Look, Daryl, maybe we should just head back.

153
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,040
No.

154
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,400
Not without the kid.

155
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,360
Is that...

156
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,900
Is that who Isabelle was talking about ?

157
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,220
He was supposed to meet us here.

158
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,300
It's cold.

159
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,980
Fuck !

160
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,600
Hey.

161
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:29,800
Hey.

162
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,140
He was here.

163
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,240
Okay.

164
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,740
He left us for me.

165
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,460
Okay, okay, hey.

166
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,580
Let's find him together, okay ?

167
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,140
Okay.

168
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:46,740
Come on.

169
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,700
We must have just gone through here.

170
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,920
We can't be too far behind.

171
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,220
So, Isabelle...

172
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,380
Yeah, we helped each other out.

173
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,440
I don't think I'd be here without her.

174
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,140
You're a pilot.

175
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,060
What did you do ?

176
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,240
Just load up the plane and fly all the way to Maine ?

177
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,460
I stopped in Greenland to refuel.

178
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,180
That's a whole other story.

179
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,840
You just left on a hunch ?

180
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,900
Left everybody back home ?

181
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,830
Yeah.

182
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,930
Just flew halfway around the world on a feeling.

183
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,430
We were supposed to come back.

184
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,970
Yeah, I was trying.

185
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,460
Well...

186
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,980
One thing's for sure.

187
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,900
Not in Ohio anymore.

188
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,690
Depeison.

189
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,660
What ?

190
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,040
It's a French word.

191
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,440
Uh-huh.

192
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,740
It means a place that makes you see things different.

193
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,510
Oh.

194
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,080
What ?

195
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,560
What ?

196
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,380
Is she speaking French ?

197
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,000
Me, you, here ?

198
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,020
This is crazy.

199
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,240
No, it's stupid.

200
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,960
It's crazy.

201
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
I met a guy who helped me out.

202
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,220
His name is Codron.

203
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,100
He said he knows you.

204
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,140
I met him at that Maison Mare place.

205
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,260
Well, Janae got him.

206
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,320
She's a piece of work.

207
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,320
He helped you find me ?

208
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,060
He said he did it for the boy.

209
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:02,410
Oh.

210
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,960
Where's the boy ?

211
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,500
Is he with the American ?

212
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,660
You won the battle and left the boy alone.

213
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,620
But I intend to win the war.

214
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,120
The war ?

215
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,880
Our war should be with the dead.

216
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,420
With hopelessness, with despair, not some innocent child.

217
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,420
Empathy, concern.

218
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,240
I can see how you love this ship and this mission.

219
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:37,520
Do you think all this time I've been relying on only the truth ?

220
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,150
We found the nun.

221
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:45,910
Isabelle.

222
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,690
She won't tell you anything.

223
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,130
Not anymore, no.

224
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,210
Was she hiding the boy ?

225
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,930
Did she fear what you would do to him ?

226
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,330
She had nothing to fear.

227
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,250
But you do.

228
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,110
I fear for my people.

229
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,850
For the future.

230
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,230
When the boy escaped,

231
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,130
I feared that God was protecting him from me.

232
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,980
I doubted myself, even my faith.

233
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,560
But I don't anymore.

234
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,340
Because I realize now that God was protecting him from you.

235
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,680
Does the American work for God ?

236
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,600
We all serve him.

237
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,400
Whether we believe or not, even you.

238
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,540
So if I find the boy,

239
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,400
it will prove God is on my side.

240
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,660
I wouldn't worry so much about the future.

241
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,440
You don't have one.

242
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,740
What ?

243
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,620
High school French.

244
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,620
Which means...

245
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,400
Where's the train station ?

246
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,540
If you find a train, you do all the talking.

247
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:22,780
Madame Bourgeois.

248
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,260
If you'd miss a verb, she'd crack your knuckles with her ruler.

249
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,580
She was a math teacher too.

250
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,180
Wasn't very good at that either.

251
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,820
You know, I never really went anywhere before.

252
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,060
We've been places.

253
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,640
You know what I mean.

254
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,940
When I was a kid, my dad had this whole globe next to the TV.

255
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,860
And he'd spin it around.

256
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,740
Think how easy it would be to see the world.

257
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,560
So why didn't you ?

258
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,380
I became a mom.

259
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,180
It was my world.

260
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,780
You said on the radio that time someone came back.

261
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,640
Who was it ?

262
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,380
It wasn't a person.

263
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
It was a feeling.

264
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,980
Everything at Commonwealth just got so quiet.

265
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,280
All that old stuff came back like ghosts.

266
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,240
So I got out of there.

267
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,480
And I was worried about you.

268
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,340
Trash ?

269
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:23,660
Yeah.

270
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,290
More than two people.

271
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,390
Someone caught up to him.

272
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,960
Mr. Dickson ?

273
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,420
Who the fuck are you ?

274
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,080
Saint-Isabelle ?

275
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:13,960
Welcome.

276
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,480
I'm Didi.

277
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,320
He's Théo.

278
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,570
The boys said you would come.

279
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,530
I'm out for a drink when I see them.

280
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,950
Didi, she loves the white mushrooms.

281
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,710
Thank you.

282
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:35,930
It's good.

283
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,590
No, morning's fine.

284
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,770
It's pitch black out there right now.

285
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,450
What ?

286
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,150
Enjoy dinner.

287
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,130
Rest.

288
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,090
Sister Isabelle knows best.

289
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,940
When was the last time any of this worked ?

290
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,620
Oh, who can remember ?

291
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,380
I learned to drive in this truck.

292
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,480
And learned a few other things too.

293
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,200
But you grew up here ?

294
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,880
Fourth generation.

295
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,000
We sold carrots to the Germans in the first world war.

296
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,160
Nazis in the second.

297
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,040
And American soldiers after that.

298
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,060
Armies come and go.

299
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,020
We're still here.

300
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,040
This one's shot.

301
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,160
It's been converted though.

302
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,020
You got any ethanol ?

303
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,320
In the barn.

304
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,300
This one ain't bad.

305
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,520
Let me find a battery.

306
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,620
One that holds a charge.

307
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,600
A few hoses ?

308
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,400
Oh, I know a place to find these things.

309
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,500
Let me get my walking shoes.

310
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,260
I can take you.

311
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,100
Alright.

312
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,600
I miss young people.

313
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,960
All the children grew up and left so long ago.

314
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,460
It was nice having Laurent here.

315
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,740
He's only a day.

316
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,880
Like you said, he's a really sweet kid.

317
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,180
He's very fond of his aunt Isabelle.

318
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,440
And Daryl, he went on and on.

319
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,540
Daryl's a really good influence.

320
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,120
And we talk about the two of you.

321
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,000
Sometimes, children see things we're afraid to look at.

322
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,460
Why do I get the feeling you're trying to tell me something ?

323
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,360
Laurent thinks that Daryl loves you but won't say it

324
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,600
because if he says it, he won't be able to leave.

325
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,160
It's a little more complicated than that.

326
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,460
Not to a child.

327
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,960
And not to me.

328
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,300
I know how rare love is.

329
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,150
How long have the two of you been married ?

330
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,270
Daryl ?

331
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,810
We're not married.

332
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,010
My husband died years ago.

333
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:51,570
My children, grandchildren, everyone's gone.

334
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,930
You seem so happy.

335
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,550
For a long time, I wasn't.

336
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,230
Like Daryl.

337
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:06,310
I was turned between the world I lost and the one I found.

338
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,470
But...

339
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,520
one must look for a way to...

340
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,110
keep living.

341
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,760
Not so easy sometimes.

342
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,180
Reasons are everywhere.

343
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,700
Good song.

344
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,620
Love.

345
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:33,620
Here you go, darling.

346
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,060
Thank you.

347
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:48,540
I'm glad he put on his walking boots.

348
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,280
This place gives me the creeps.

349
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,840
The walkers have walkers.

350
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,980
Hey !

351
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,020
Bonjour, madame Dicasse !

352
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,000
Kind lady.

353
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,680
And good dentist.

354
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,380
I still have lots of teeth left.

355
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,000
Hey !

356
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,080
Monsieur Roux !

357
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,760
The baker.

358
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,520
Very quiet.

359
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,980
Makes more noise now than when he was alive.

360
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,400
Sadly, this whole street has passed on.

361
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,480
Couldn't you just bury him ?

362
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,700
There's only old people left in the village.

363
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,640
Old people burying old people ?

364
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,160
Too hard.

365
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,960
So when someone dies,

366
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,140
we lock the gate

367
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,920
and pay respect when we pass by.

368
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,660
That's a new one.

369
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:29,380
Yeah.

370
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,280
Monsieur Toussaint !

371
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,380
Stop !

372
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,860
You stay here.

373
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,100
I talk to him first.

374
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,040
All right.

375
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,940
Didi says Laurent idolizes you.

376
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,700
She just spent one day with him.

377
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,460
He made a big impression.

378
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,720
Sounds like he's gonna do really well at Commonwealth.

379
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,540
He's got friends in Paris.

380
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,060
It's better he stays with them.

381
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,940
Better for who ?

382
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,020
He's your responsibility.

383
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,100
Maybe I don't want that.

384
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,440
What about the kids back home ?

385
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,400
This is different.

386
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,600
Is it ?

387
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:18,820
Yeah.

388
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,500
Yeah, it is.

389
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,260
I don't want to lose him.

390
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,780
Will you end up like me ?

391
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,900
Is that what you're afraid of ?

392
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:32,940
No.

393
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,880
No, I ain't afraid of that.

394
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:39,940
Yeah.

395
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,720
Come on.

396
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,600
Hurry up.

397
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:58,270
Oh, yeah.

398
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,130
Yeah, this will work.

399
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,330
American ?

400
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:01,910
Yes.

401
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,410
I like the United States.

402
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,430
Thank you.

403
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,179
Thank you.

404
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:13,920
I'll help you.

405
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,199
Thank you.

406
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:21,430
What is it, dear ?

407
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,410
You can tell me.

408
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,060
I had a little girl.

409
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,840
I got through it.

410
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,720
You will too.

411
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,120
Go ahead.

412
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,160
We'll go in together.

413
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:26,520
Go ahead, give it some gas.

414
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,040
Just a little.

415
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,420
Stop !

416
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,700
Stop !

417
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,880
I said a little.

418
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,260
There was a little.

419
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,520
No, that was too much.

420
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,340
How am I supposed to know how much is too much ?

421
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:37,900
Well, you listen.

422
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,240
And if it sounds like it's too much,

423
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:39,980
then it's too much.

424
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,020
Maybe you're too much.

425
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,500
What ?

426
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,080
What ?

427
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,780
What ?

428
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,320
What ?

429
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,060
Please, don't stop.

430
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,940
It's a good show.

431
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,480
Like an old married couple.

432
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,940
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

433
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,840
Mr. Pouvoir, you hide here.

434
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,560
They're going to kill him.

435
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,800
We don't know that.

436
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,280
Get down.

437
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,620
I guess Janae won the battle.

438
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,770
I know you had people there.

439
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:26,650
Isabelle and Laurent.

440
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,100
It's from Judith.

441
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,080
How is she ?

442
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,900
She didn't want me to go.

443
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,420
Part of her knew I had to

444
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,180
if there was a chance I could find you.

445
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,680
I guess I'm just surprised

446
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,240
you got so close to people here.

447
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,680
I didn't mean to.

448
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,670
It's hard to explain, I guess.

449
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,570
Well, if you ever want to try.

450
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:28,450
Hey.

451
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,240
I'm glad you came.

452
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:36,780
Me too.

453
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,500
You leave ?

454
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,220
Long trip.

455
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,120
Oh, too bad.

456
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,620
Did he make something special ?

457
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,860
Her truffle eggs.

458
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,860
They're very truffle ?

459
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,620
No, huh ?

460
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,120
Like sex.

461
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,680
Or the tongue.

462
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,840
Forgive me, sister.

463
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,420
Hey, Vinnie.

464
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,120
I don't see.

465
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,680
We'll make it quick.

466
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:20,320
Come on.

467
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:26,210
Jesus.

468
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,390
I'm sorry.

469
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,450
These are the best eggs I've ever had.

470
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:34,950
Yeah, truffle.

471
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,850
You might have to give me some of these.

472
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:38,950
You need a good eye

473
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,250
and a lot of patience.

474
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,450
They're very hard to find.

475
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,450
Only for special occasions.

476
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,490
Thank you for the car.

477
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,350
And for all you've done.

478
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,870
What are your plans ?

479
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,110
After you find Laurent,

480
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,510
will you stay in Paris ?

481
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,650
How long we're still working it out ?

482
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:24,020
What are you doing ?

483
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,020
Where are you ?

484
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,140
What does it mean ?

485
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,180
Who they are for you ?

486
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,350
Theo, why ?

487
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,250
For you, my love.

488
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:52,790
For us.

489
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,450
Do you know who those people are ?

490
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,570
Armies come and go.

491
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,870
You don't survive by picking the losing side.

492
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,590
Come with me.

493
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,150
Crazy old man.

494
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:24,810
What a woman.

495
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:25,690
Sex.

496
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:26,730
Sorry.

497
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,380
You can hide down there.

498
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:39,970
Sir ?

499
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:44,250
Do you know why I'm here ?

500
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,430
Yes, madam.

501
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:49,770
They left just after breakfast.

502
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,650
We did what we could

503
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,130
to reassure them,

504
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,330
but they were wary.

505
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:54,430
Theo.

506
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,970
I'm going to search the barn.

507
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:09,350
Cover me.

508
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:10,610
I'll get the car.

509
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,120
It smells good.

510
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,200
May I ?

511
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,640
You'll be honored.

512
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:35,660
Truffle.

513
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:47,950
What a refinement.

514
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:50,090
We don't have salt,

515
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:50,810
but we have truffle.

516
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:06,190
Who are we looking for ?

517
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:08,770
They are very dangerous.

518
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:12,330
It's the enemy,

519
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:12,950
in truth.

520
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,050
We are at war.

521
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,640
Do you know who I am ?

522
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,300
Yes, I heard about you.

523
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,400
By my father.

524
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:27,810
Admirable longevity.

525
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:28,570
No.

526
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:30,670
He died young,

527
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:31,990
of wounds received

528
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,130
while fighting the Maquis.

529
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:36,050
But he told me about people like you

530
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:37,130
who came to the village

531
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:38,370
during this other war.

532
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:41,990
He was also looking for children

533
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,620
to put in trains.

534
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,600
Is that how you see us ?

535
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,400
Guigui.

536
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:22,490
I told you,

537
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:23,670
they left hours ago.

538
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:26,870
How can his eyes

539
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,070
still be warm ?

540
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,060
They are here somewhere.

541
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,420
We'll search the house.

542
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:37,840
No.

543
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,620
Let them do it.

544
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,800
If there is one thing

545
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,940
that the dead are capable of,

546
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:45,760
it is to scare the living.

547
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,400
Come on, let's go !

548
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,260
All right.

549
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,160
What is it ?

550
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,640
Quick, quick, quick !

551
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,260
Yes, come on, quick !

552
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,190
Be careful.

553
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:55,590
They are coming !

554
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,320
About how someone like you

555
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,060
could turn...

556
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,960
turn into this.

557
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,690
Do you know what else I've seen ?

558
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:23,850
The City of Lights,

559
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:25,450
gone dark,

560
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:26,650
where the wealthy

561
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:27,930
fled to their villas

562
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:28,690
and their chateaux.

563
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,190
Families huddled in terror

564
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:33,210
under the Pont Neuf,

565
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,630
as badgers took the powerful

566
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:37,350
down the Seine for refuge.

567
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:42,030
So you're making up for that now ?

568
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,310
And while the great works

569
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:43,930
were safe,

570
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,530
I saw my love

571
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,840
devoured by the monsters they made,

572
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,480
five feet from me,

573
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,560
on the other side of the glass.

574
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,200
Have you ever known

575
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,260
that kind of loss ?

576
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:45,040
I'm sorry.

577
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:00,090
We're all together, you know ?

578
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:02,770
Yeah, I do.

579
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,640
And I never ever

580
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,760
stopped trying to get home to you.

581
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,500
The longer I stayed here,

582
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,740
the harder it got.

583
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,720
You loved her.

584
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,820
You know Laurent's coming home with us,

585
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:31,400
right ?

586
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,580
Yeah, I know.

587
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,620
Madame Jeunet is dead.

588
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,300
Killed by the American.

589
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:12,220
She went after the boy

590
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,040
and now she's gone.

591
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,060
There isn't proof

592
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,320
that God is on her side.

593
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,220
Marine's way was not enough.

594
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,680
But neither is yours.

595
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,950
So now what ?

596
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,180
All is forgiven,

597
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,720
my friends.

598
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:13,060
All is forgiven.

599
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:19,930
Power of the living,

600
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,200
welcome to the union of hope.

601
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:29,050
Let us unite our dreams

602
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:31,710
for a better, stronger future.

603
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:34,570
Let us merge our dreams

604
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:37,270
for a better, stronger future.

605
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,740
Ahead is the promised land.

606
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,160
Laurent will take us there.

607
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,060
Let's find the child.
