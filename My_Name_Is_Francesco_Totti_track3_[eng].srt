1
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,680
(Totti) I think the first word that I could say was "football”.

2
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,800
In 1977, in Porto San Giorgio,

3
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,080
with all my cousins, uncles and aunts.

4
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,240
The sea, the beach, the games.

5
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,280
For me it was all new.
It was beautiful.

6
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,480
That's my mother.

7
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,840
This is my father.

8
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,280
This is me.

9
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,120
I was playing football.

10
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,520
What's in my mind is only to kick the ball around.

11
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,800
From there this all started.

12
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,920
(Man) Roma without Totti
is like a city without the sun.

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,120
(Man 2) The game is over.
They took the ball away from us.

14
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,240
(Man 3) I don't believe it.
If I must think about tomorrow, I prefer thinking about yesterday.

15
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,160
(Woman) For me this is Roma’s funeral.
For me, Roma dies here.

16
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,680
(Totti) I don't believe that I'm done.

17
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,720
Starting from tomorrow, I will no longer
wear my boots. No more jersey. Nothing.

18
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,720
It is not possible.

19
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,320
I have been here
for 25 years of my life.

20
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,920
Such memories.

21
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,680
(Carlo Zampa) Players are on him.

22
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,920
(Carlo Zampa) He shoots!

23
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,120
(CROWD NOISE)

24
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,320
- (Caressa) He got away.
- (Compagnoni) He’s looking for an opening.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,760
(Caressa) He’s almost inside the penalty box!

26
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,080
- Totti !
- (Compagnoni) Missed it by a whisker!

27
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,360
(Caressa) Totti is free!
Pallonetto !

28
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,640
Totti !

29
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,120
(CROWD OVERJOYED)

30
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,080
(Totti) Tomorrow will be the last time
I play as a professional footballer.

31
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,320
My name is Francesco Totti.

32
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,760
I am the captain of AS Roma.

33
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,520
(CROWD OVERJOYED)

34
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,840
(Totti) In 1983, it had been 40 years
since Roma last won the Scudetto

35
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,040
"We were born to suffer", they say.

36
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,560
(CROWD OVERJOYED)

37
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,880
(HORN)

38
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,480
(Totti) I was a little boy.

39
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,040
I remember the horns,
the noise, the flags.

40
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,120
Wherever you went,

41
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,560
there was chaos everywhere.

42
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,440
That summer, after school,

43
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,120
in the afternoon we always
gathered at Manzoni.

44
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,160
With me, there were
my brother Riccardo,

45
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,760
my cousin Angelo,

46
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,480
Antonio ‘the Dead’,
because he was white like a corpse,

47
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,120
then there was Bambino

48
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,640
the two Giancarlo: Giancarlo Ciccacci
and Giancarlo Pantano.

49
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,120
Our favorite game
was Paperelle (The Ducklings)

50
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,480
It’s a group of children
standing at the top of the ladder.

51
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,520
They started walking
one after another.

52
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,360
They went down the step
to the end of the ladder.

53
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,400
Below,a kid must kick the ball
and hit all these ‘ducks’.

54
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,120
Who hit the most ducks
won an ice cream.

55
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,600
I was small.

56
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,840
They never let me play.

57
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,840
One day, I persuaded them,
or maybe, I made them feel pity for me

58
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,000
Then they asked me: "Do you want to play ?"

59
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,560
In that moment, I thought of both
everything and nothing at once.

60
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,080
But I realized, when it was my turn,

61
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,600
the sound of the ball was different.

62
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
I kicked hard.

63
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,760
Hard and precise.

64
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,560
I kicked and hit a duck.

65
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,680
I kicked and hit another duck.

66
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,680
I took them all.

67
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,320
They couldn't believe it.

68
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,720
One day, my cousin Angelo told me:

69
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,080
"Let's go and have a trial
at Fortitudo Football School."

70
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,760
It was only a hundred meters from home.

71
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,480
We lived in Via Vetulonia.

72
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,640
I lived there with my father, my mother,
my brother, and my grandfather.

73
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,000
This was my little family.

74
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,240
As a child, I was very shy.

75
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,800
I was not socializing as I should have.

76
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,480
At school, I closed myself off.

77
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,240
However, with the excuse
that I am now a football player,

78
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,640
every now and then I hid
that problem behind.

79
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,480
Finally when I was ten years old,
I went to play for Lodigiani.

80
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,600
Lodigiani was already an important team.

81
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,440
It was Roma, Lazio, Lodigiani

82
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,680
Lodigiani was Rome's third team.

83
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,560
We said they're our city's second team,
because Roma is first, and then Lodigiani.

84
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,920
Lazio is the third.

85
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,000
(CROWD OVERJOYED)

86
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,040
(Totti) During this time, my father and uncle
gave me 5000 Lira for every goal I scored.

87
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,560
In fact, I made them regret this.

88
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,760
I emptied their wallets!

89
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,640
My father never praised me.

90
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,880
My mother every now and then,
secretly, complimented me.

91
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,200
She is the one
I am most attached to.

92
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,520
My dad worked until late every day.

93
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,040
So she picked me up from school,
and took me to trainings,

94
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,160
She waited for me out there.

95
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,320
My parents saw a passion in me.

96
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,560
I cannot let go of football.

97
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,480
On Saturday, when everyone went out,
I stayed at home and slept.

98
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,480
I would sit there, and watch the games.

99
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,920
I drank a glass of cold milk
before going to bed.

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,600
In the morning at 7, I woke up.
I ate breakfast and went to training.

101
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
(Man) Go!

102
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,480
(Totti) Words got out
that there was this strong kid.

103
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,400
So much that the coach told me:
"Watch out, they will hurt you."

104
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,480
"Don't respond to them, watch out."

105
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,040
(Man) "Daje"!

106
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,040
(PROTESTING VOICES)

107
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,720
- (Woman) Fool!
- (Woman 2) Throw the ball out!

108
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,360
(Man 2) You are good!

109
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,320
(Totti) I was still a kid,

110
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,600
so I hadn’t  really thought about big things or my future.

111
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,920
But these are moments
that you hardly forget.

112
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,480
In 1989 the president of Lodigiani called me,

113
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,280
because both Roma and Lazio wanted me to play for them.

114
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,560
Being a family of Roma supporters,

115
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,480
it was impossible
to take another path.

116
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,000
If I had chosen Lazio, my family
would never spoke with me again!

117
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,480
The first time I was at Trigoria,
it was like a dream.

118
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,480
I was 12, 13 years old.

119
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,360
I walked in front the of training ground.
I saw the first team training.

120
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,000
I feel like the happiest kid in the world.

121
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,720
Seeing Giannini during training

122
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,360
was the best part of it.

123
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,640
He was the captain.

124
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,640
He was my idol.

125
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,160
Then he was from Rome.

126
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,080
The Prince, they called him.

127
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,800
When I was on the field, I changed.

128
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,000
That is, I closed in on myself
and I tried to do things easily.

129
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,880
I succeeded in doing difficult things.

130
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,840
In fact they always put me
to play with the older kids.

131
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,000
(CROWD OVERJOYED)

132
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,680
(Totti) Did you see that? Let's rewind.

133
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,280
Pay attention, ok?

134
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,000
I turned my head to look
where my team-mates were.

135
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,520
or where the opponents were..

136
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,160
Another kid won't do this.

137
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,360
He’ll watch the ball instead

138
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,520
When I played, everyone came to watch.

139
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,840
Friends, cousins, uncles.

140
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,480
When you entered the field,
the first thing you did,

141
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,560
was to look for your
mother and father.

142
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,160
If you hear the voices of my parents,
they were much worse than they are now.

143
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,480
Before, they would say:
"Break his legs!” “Get in wrong! "

144
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,720
(WHISTLE)

145
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,240
(Man) Hey referee, when will you give him a yellow card?

146
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,040
- "Mortacci tua!”
- (Man 2) And who doesn't tell him!

147
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,600
(Together) “Mortacci tua!”

148
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,000
(Totti) At that time, I used to go to the curva sud
with my brother, cousins, and friends

149
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,080
with the scooter, every Sunday.

150
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,000
The match started at 3 pm.

151
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,200
We left our house around 9 am.

152
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,000
We would be sitting there and playing cards,
even with people we didn't know,

153
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,080
while waiting for the game to start.

154
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,240
(Together) # E la Lazio merda #

155
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,920
(Totti) When it’s derby day between Roma and Lazio,

156
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,760
there was delirium in the curva.

157
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,240
There was simply 360 degree of hatred.

158
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,680
(Together) # Lazio, Lazio, fuck you #

159
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,480
(WHISTLES)

160
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
(EXPLOSION)

161
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,000
(Totti) It's a different game
from all the others.

162
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,320
It was overwhelming.

163
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,200
(Martellini) Be careful,
Sclosa already has a yellow card.

164
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,280
(Totti) There were people
who preferred Roma win the two derbies

165
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,040
than winning the Scudetto.

166
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,120
(PROTESTING VOICES)

167
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,760
(Martellini) Goal!

168
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,040
(Totti) Giannini was the one who gave me

169
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,440
positivity, strength, and competitive spirit.

170
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,040
I saw him as an icon.

171
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,000
When I came back home, I stood in front of  the mirror.

172
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,760
I said to myself: "One day,
I am going to be like him. "

173
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,840
One day, on a Saturday afternoon,

174
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,880
at the end of the first half we were leading 2-0.
I scored two goals with the Primavera.

175
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,520
At a certain point,
they called me off the pitch.

176
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Strange.

177
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
I scored two goals, then you sub me off?

178
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,440
Something serious will happen.

179
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,160
(Woman) Hey where are you going? What did he do ?

180
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,160
(Totti) They told me: "Go the the locker room, and take a shower "

181
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,200
"You must leave with the first team for Brescia. "

182
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,560
I was lightning struck.

183
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,160
At first, I didn't even want to leave.

184
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,680
I already had plan for Saturday night.

185
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,440
Disco, dinner with friends.
Everything.

186
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,080
I had become a normal person on Saturday night.

187
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,480
When you get to the end,
it's true, 25 years is a long time.

188
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,400
But looking back at what I have done,
it feels very short.

189
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,000
(Mandolesi) Roma is in the lead

190
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,440
with two goals scored in the first half
by Caniggia and Mihajlović.

191
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,560
(Totti) There were ten minutes left.

192
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,680
I had no hope of playing.

193
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,160
(Mandolesi) Rizzitelli is out, leaving
the place for the young Francesco Totti.

194
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,800
(Totti) Imagining myself on the field,
together with the team, was unthinkable.

195
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,840
It is as if they were making fun of me.

196
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,880
All surreal.

197
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,760
From there, my whole life changed.

198
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,400
From that day on, I started training
almost always with the first team.

199
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,480
Every morning.
Then I went to school.

200
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,760
For me it was a problem.

201
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,600
But it is a train that passes only once.

202
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,240
Fortunately, I managed to get on it.

203
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,440
And to think again, at that moment,
Roma was getting worse and worse.

204
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,600
(Journalist) The longest day
in the history of the A.S. Roma.

205
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,480
(Mannoni) President Ciarrapico
is in jail,

206
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,360
The company is in liquidation.
No prospective buyers to be seen.

207
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,920
(Totti) Fortunately, Franco Sensi arrived.

208
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,640
I have never done interviews.
Leave me alone.

209
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,640
I’m telling you that Roma
will not be without parents.

210
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,200
(Totti) First of all,

211
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,080
Sensi hired a Roman coach
who is also a Roma fan like us.

212
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,360
Mazzone was like a father to me.

213
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:59,080
He raised me through and through,
both on and off the pitch.

214
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,560
I was lucky to have
him in those years.

215
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,600
(Pizzul) Cappioli, Berretta,

216
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,680
Totti, the boy who impressed the most
among the Primavera ranks.

217
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,520
(Totti) If it was up to him,
he would always play me.

218
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,080
(Pizzul) Again a wonderful control
from Totti,

219
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,600
He's running from the right.

220
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,480
Great play by Totti,
passed to Giannini.

221
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,160
He shoots! Blocked by Pagliuca.

222
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,240
(Totti) To make me grow and show
me that he cared about me,

223
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,840
when reporters kept insisting that Totti must play,

224
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,480
he did the opposite.

225
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,160
(Pizzul) Totti coming off,
very good performance by Francesco Totti.

226
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,320
(Totti) But he never told me
whether he would play me or not.

227
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,280
He announced the formation
two hours before the game started.

228
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,080
It was to protect me.

229
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,560
Then what did he do? In the derby, he threw me in.

230
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,880
It was my first derby.

231
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,720
(Sarta) Winter,
pressed by Carica...

232
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,400
Goal! Lazio!

233
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,240
Signori scored!

234
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,200
Perfect finish by Signori.
Lazio is ahead after six minutes.

235
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,760
Totti entered the field,
not yet 18 years old.

236
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,440
Totti, with the number 16

237
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,360
Mazzone's wild card to level the score.

238
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,720
(WHISTLES)

239
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,480
(Totti) I would have done anything
in that moment.

240
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,560
Before, when a young player entered the pitch
older players would play hard on him,

241
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,360
To scare him.

242
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,480
In that moment,
you have to be a little smarter.

243
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,840
(Sarta), Totti again.

244
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,520
One on one with Negro, Totti!

245
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,920
Totti is inside the penalty box
He fell down. Penalty!

246
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,840
Penalty kick!

247
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,000
(Totti) I felt the slightest contact.

248
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,880
I was thinking: "Now I’ll throw myself on the ground,
hoping that the referee whistles. "

249
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,680
(Sarta) Although I have not seen
any touch on the legs ...

250
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,040
(Totti) I was quite shrewd.

251
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,840
(Sarta) Taking the penalty

252
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,160
is Giuseppe Giannini,
against Luca Marchegiani.

253
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,920
(Totti) Giannini, as the captain,

254
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,400
had double responsibilities
than the other players.

255
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,480
(Sarta) In a very crucial moment.

256
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,320
(Totti) You don't know how hard my heart was beating.

257
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,120
(Seamstress) It's 25 minutes in the second half,
Giannini's running up. He shoots!

258
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,280
Parried away by Marchegiani!

259
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,920
Marchegiani saved
Giannini's penalty kick!

260
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Marchegiani stopped the penalty kick
of the Roma captain

261
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,760
(Totti) The weight of the
whole world fell on me

262
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,200
I could have said: "If only I was the one who took the penalty
surely I would have scored."

263
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,480
But with all those "buts”
and "ifs", talking is easy.

264
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,160
(Sarta) Here comes the final whistle.
Lazio has won the derby!

265
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,640
(Totti) Then, as we lost the derby,
people’s vision became blurred, as they say.

266
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,480
They unleased their frustrations against our <i>bandiera</i>, Giannini.

267
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,120
(Giannini) When they put their hands on
my family members, everything changes.

268
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,680
(Totti) Let’s rewind a little.

269
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,160
I did not remember
that they had shoved him.

270
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,440
It used to be like this.

271
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,480
You see it ? First the fans,
they would all sit up there.

272
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,040
If you lost the derby, then you would have six months
of continuous harassments.

273
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,560
But it was much nicer.

274
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,040
Then it came.
my first goal in Serie A.

275
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,120
(CROWD OVERJOYED)

276
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,520
(Totti) For me it was
the realization of everything,

277
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,720
of my entire life up to that point.

278
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,400
Of course, I would have preferred
scoring it under the curva sud.

279
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,480
Then in the end I was there.

280
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,760
A few weeks later, I turned 18.

281
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,160
I’m coming of age.

282
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,320
Guess who showed up at midnight?

283
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,080
The Prince.

284
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,800
Giannini, with a birthday cake.

285
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,640
He gave me a surprise.

286
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,600
He made it the best birthday
I could have ever imagined.

287
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,680
At that time, I had people everywhere.

288
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,400
Down there, in front of the house.

289
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,000
I couldn't go for a coffee.
I couldn’t even play pinball.

290
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,880
I could no longer go out.

291
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,640
I hadn't thought this life would become so hard.
292
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,040
Beautiful, but also difficult at the same time.

292
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,040
I no longer had a private life.

293
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,080
(Mandolesi) Francesco Totti, please give him a round of applause.

294
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,480
Francesco, thank you.

295
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,520
I know you express yourself best on the pitch.

296
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,400
Not in a hot TV studio.

297
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,160
Yes, in fact, on the pitch it is different
than on the television.

298
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,080
Playing for the team of your home city,

299
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,880
the one you supported
when you were a child.

300
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,520
Thinking that two years ago
I was still there in curva sud.

301
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,600
I thank you.

302
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,480
I would also express my gratitude to your mom,
who is a very nice person.

303
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,680
Yes. We'd better leave my mom out of this.

304
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,440
- What's out of this ?
- They all say I’m a mama’s boy

305
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
- Is it true?
- True

306
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,480
- It’s a good thing!
- Mums will always be mums.

307
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,840
(Totti) We have a house in Torvaianica,

308
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,920
where all our friends were. All of them.

309
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,400
This was the most beautiful time
in the summer.

310
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,040
The thought of having to leave
with the national team,

311
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,480
the first long trip

312
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,120
I would not exchange it
for everything in the world.

313
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,920
Come on, all together. Cheese!

314
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,920
(Totti) These are all my uncles and aunties.
My father's sister, uncle Augusto.

315
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,560
- (Uncle) Hey nephews, your turn is later.
- # Fratelli d'Italia #

316
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,800
(Totti) Aunt Teresa, aunt Lucia, uncle Ennio.
Mamma mia!

317
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,160
Roberto's girlfriend, my cousin.

318
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,600
Claudia

319
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,600
It was 50 degrees, it was noon.

320
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,240
It was really hot.

321
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Here is my father.
Look at my mother, how young she was.

322
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,040
- (Uncle) Aren't you happy?
- Eh !

323
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,000
(Totti) My brother, who worked in the cinema,
did the filming.

324
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,040
He actually drives trucks.

325
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,640
But to be honest, holding camera on his shoulder
wasn’t necessarily rocket science.

326
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,520
I think this was the first game
I went abroad.

327
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,120
It was a friendly match at Wembley,

328
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,600
the most important stadium that could ever be.

329
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,360
(WHISTLES)

330
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,600
(Totti) I was a simple boy,
shy, and reserved.

331
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,640
It bothered me when they whistled
against me or called my name.

332
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,720
(CROWD OVERJOYED)

333
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,320
(Totti) You don't believe in destiny, do you?

334
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,320
I do.

335
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,840
We could only understand destiny
after we have arrived at the end.

336
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,760
Until you have lived it,
don't even think about destiny.

337
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,480
Until something happens to you.

338
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,400
(CROWD NOISE)

339
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,800
(Cerqueti) Here is Roma after Mazzone.

340
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,320
An Argentinian, 47 years old.

341
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,520
In his first interview
as a Giallorossi manager,

342
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,440
He does not forget his Italian grandfather.

343
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,080
"Bianchi” or “Bianci”,
which do you prefer to be called?

344
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,600
I am "Bianchi", because "Bianchi" is from here.

345
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,080
(Totti) Bianchi is the one
who wanted to kick me away from Roma.

346
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,000
Because he,

347
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,320
doesn't like having Roman players in his team.

348
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,760
The moment I knew

349
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,480
that they will not be extending
Giannini's contract,

350
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,200
I sensed that in football
things could change in an instant.

351
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,640
So you might have to roll up your sleeves

352
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,280
and leave without the people you trusted.

353
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,480
Carlos Bianchi
also targetted another player.

354
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,440
He wanted to replace me
with Jari Litmanen.

355
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,480
Litmanen was already Litmanen.

356
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,840
I was a young player.
He was a well-established player.

357
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,000
In February they organized
this tournament at the Olimpico.

358
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,200
A mini tournament among Roma, Borussia, and Ajax.

359
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,040
The tournament was called “Città di Roma”.

360
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,720
For Bianchi it was the right opportunity
to show people how good Litmanen was,

361
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,640
who was playing for Ajax.

362
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,040
I shouldn't have been there

363
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,000
because I had to leave
with Under 21 National Team.

364
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,400
What happened instead? They didn't call me up.

365
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,440
And there I was.

366
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,000
(Piccinini) Eyes on Totti.

367
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,520
Excellent touches, Totti.

368
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,600
Great chance, Totti! Totti ! Totti !

369
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,720
It’s still him!

370
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
Totti !

371
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,160
Sublime touch and a fantastic goal!

372
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
The fans are all cheered for him.

373
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,360
(Totti) Litmanen had an ordinary tournament.

374
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,840
I played two great matches.

375
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,920
(Piccinini) Totti, with his right foot!

376
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,880
Fantastic goal!

377
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,680
Fantastic goal! It’s him again!

378
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,000
(Bagni) For me, Totti must stay.
He has shown us some great things.

379
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,880
(Totti) The Città di Roma Tournament
was the destiny for everything,

380
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,840
of all my career with Roma.

381
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,440
- The future of Totti?
- Totti's future is with Roma.

382
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
He stays at Roma.

383
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,480
- Yes, but maybe a loan move?
- No, he stays at Roma and he plays for Roma.

384
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,920
- Just that.
-  That’s the president.

385
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,160
(Totti) Bianchi said: "Either me or him."

386
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,280
The president chose me.

387
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,560
(Speaker) Zdeněk Zeman !

388
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,080
(CROWD OVERJOYED)

389
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,400
(Totti) The first time I saw Zeman,
I was scared.

390
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,240
The rumors that were around said
that he was a maniac.

391
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,000
For him, all you need to do is just run.

392
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,400
Run, run, run until you drop.

393
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,400
Plus he didn't let you eat.

394
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,920
I was anxious.

395
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,360
I was young, I said to myself: "Mamma mia.”

396
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,480
- Look at his pectoral muscles
- (Totti) He went to the gym.

397
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,440
(Totti) Instead I found him
a clean, real person,

398
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,600
nice, easy-going.

399
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,720
Every time I entered the pitch, he said

400
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,000
"With the feet you have,
you always have to shoot. "

401
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,880
"Come in and shoot."

402
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,080
"Come in and shoot."

403
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,160
He says: "If you shoot ten times,"

404
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,280
"Ten times it hits the post
and nine times you’ll score. "

405
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,560
Zeman also gave me strength
to improve physically.

406
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,440
He helped me improve my physical stature in every way.

407
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,480
(NOISES OF JUBILATION)

408
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,520
(Totti) During that period, I became the captain.

409
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,240
On one hand I was happy,
because it was my dream.

410
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,360
On the other hand,

411
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,000
I had also seen negative things
associated to being a Roma captain .

412
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,360
For me personally, my responsibilities
have doubled, tripled.

413
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,760
When Zeman left, I thought: "What now?"

414
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,600
That summer I was in Torvaianica.

415
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,280
The news came out
that Roma just  hired Fabio Capello.

416
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,760
Not only me, but all Roma fans and
the players were all happy.

417
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,000
Wherever he went, he won.

418
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,040
Instead, our first year
was quite critical.

419
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,160
We finished sixth,
worse than the previous year.

420
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,400
Then the unthinkable happened.

421
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,720
(Cucchi) Collina has blown the whistle.
The match has ended.

422
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,840
Lazio are the champions of Italy.

423
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,120
(Totti) Lazio winning the Scudetto was terrifying.

424
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,880
All the Lazio fans, with trumpets,
passed in front my house.

425
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,520
I closed everything. Windows, shutters.

426
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,240
For a few days
I did not left the house.

427
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,200
In the end, if they won.
It means that they deserved it.

428
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,120
It couldn't be worse because,
after three days, in the same stadium,

429
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,240
Giannini said goodbye to football.

430
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,680
I was in the middle of the field with him
for the farewell game.

431
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,280
It was supposed to be a celebration day.

432
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,600
Unfortunately it became a nightmare.

433
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,640
In that moment,
people were very angry,

434
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,720
and they vented it all out.

435
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,400
(WHISTLES)

436
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,400
(Totti) For him it was a blow to the heart.

437
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,560
It didn't have to end like this.
It had to end with something better.

438
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,000
Even more beautiful.

439
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,320
But thank you.

440
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,920
(APPLAUSE)

441
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,040
The curtain finally rises
on the new 2000/2001 season.

442
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,760
This is the first time we have
such a strong team.

443
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:50,880
Certainly, on the three objectives of the season,
we will be able to do very important things.

444
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,400
(CROWD NOISE)

445
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,080
(Totti) And instead,
we started with the Italian Cup

446
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,080
and we were knocked off
in the first round by Atalanta.

447
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,680
There were quite heated protests in Trigoria.

448
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,880
We have to make a huge leap in quality,
also out of respect for the fans.

449
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,040
(Totti) From now on
those who have no character,

450
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,760
those who do not want to play,
they can leave.

451
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,160
(Zampa) Here is the cross.

452
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,840
Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal!

453
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,640
Goal!

454
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,720
It is Roma's first league goal!

455
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,920
Scored by who else?

456
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,880
The header from our Bimbo de Oro!

457
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,200
(Zampa) Batistuta going wide
in the penalty area. He receives the ball,

458
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,640
He shoots. Hits the crossbar. Goal!

459
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,920
Goal!

460
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,280
Gabriel Omar!

461
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,480
“The Lion King” Batistuta!

462
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,400
(Zampa) Goal!

463
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,120
Goal! Our Golden Boy

464
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,240
(Zampa) Batistuta. He shoots. Goal!

465
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,360
Goal! Goal! Goal!

466
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,840
(Zampa) Here is the cross from Il Pendolino,
for the captain. He shoots. Goal!

467
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,640
Goal, goal, goal!

468
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,240
An extraordinary goal!

469
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,800
An extraordinary goal,
from the left side!

470
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,920
(Totti) I was strong.

471
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,680
(Zampa) Inside the penalty area. Unbelievable!

472
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,480
(Totti) We started our season in the first place
and we stayed first until the end.

473
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,760
We went into pitch on Sunday.
Convinced we’d score at least two or three goals.

474
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,800
(Zampa) Ball for Batistuta. Shoot!

475
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,360
(Totti) There wasn't really another possibility.

476
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,240
(Zampa) Aldair, with the ball

477
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:47,160
(Totti) You felt that everyone is united.
Compact. Our desire to win.

478
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,280
(Zampa) Free kick, crossbar,
header, goal!

479
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,480
Goal, goal, goal! Vincenzo scored!

480
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,800
(Zampa) Here comes the cross. Goal!

481
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,640
Goal!

482
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,920
We were a winning group.

483
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,120
(Zampa) Just outside the penalty box, he shoots. Goal!

484
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,080
Goal! Vincenzo!

485
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,800
(Totti) It is impossible not to win.

486
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,560
(Zampa) Again, Montella, Montella. The ball is inside the net. Goal!

487
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,720
Goal!

488
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,280
(Totti) The penultimate match
of that season was in Naples.

489
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,360
There were nearly 10,000 Roma fans

490
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,000
Daje, Rome, Daje!

491
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,240
(Totti) If we had won, we would have wrapped the championship.

492
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,560
If Napoli had lost, they would have gone to Serie B.

493
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,200
We brought flags,
t-shirts, as if ...

494
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,120
(Tecca) Totti, Totti ! Goal!

495
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,400
2-1! Totti!

496
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,400
(Totti) And instead ...

497
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,560
(Tecca) Goal! Napoli equalized.

498
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,480
Napoli levelled the scored with Pecchia.

499
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
Everyone expected the worst.

500
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,440
(Totti) In the end we were back to
how we started.

501
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,880
With nothing.

502
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:09,160
(Tecca) 2-2. The Scudetto will be decided on the final match.

503
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,160
Roma needed a win

504
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,080
to make sure they win the Scudetto.

505
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,480
(Totti) Maybe destiny wanted

506
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,360
that the last game
is played at our home.

507
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Rome was totally silent.

508
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,200
It was like someone died.

509
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,000
More than anything, there was fear.

510
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,200
The fear that everyone's dream could just vanish.

511
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,440
Losing the Scudetto with the last match at Olimpico

512
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,120
After 20 years

513
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,760
You would never recover from that.

514
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,440
It would be the end of it all.

515
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,840
VOICES OF PROTESTS

516
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,520
(Repice) Just by a whisker!

517
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,560
Montella!
The ball refused to go inside the net.

518
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,720
Montella had...

519
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,320
It’s still 0-0 between Roma and Parma.

520
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,880
Roma are looking for the goal.
First with Batistuta, then with Montella.

521
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,320
Six minutes and 58 seconds.

522
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,480
Tommasi. Candela shows up
at the opposite side.

523
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,440
Candela now has the ball.

524
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,440
Candela crossing it to the middle.

525
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,000
And it’s goal! Goal!

526
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,920
Goal! Roma 1 - Parma 0

527
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,640
It's the 19th minute of the first half!

528
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,120
Francesco Totti scored Roma first goal!

529
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,480
(Speaker) Francesco!

530
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,640
(Together) Totti!

(FANS SINGING)

532
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,200
(Totti) Scoring that goal was my dream.

533
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,160
It wasn't even easy.

534
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,480
Do you know where other players
would have sent the ball to?

535
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,320
Towards the cameraman.

536
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,920
And after all, I scored it under the curva sud.

537
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,280
It's like I’m sending my love
towards my own people.

538
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,120
Only that it’s blocked by the net

539
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,360
Five minutes before the final whistle,
we won 3-1.

540
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,240
What happened next

541
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,880
was unthinkable.

542
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,480

543
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,800
The match is suspended, watch out.

544

Not this. Not this. Not this.

547
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,040
Not this. Not this.

00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,520
(Speaker) The match is suspended.

549
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,480
(Repice) The match is suspended. Roma is at risk.

550
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,360
These people absolutely have to get out of the pitch.

551
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,440
You don't have to do that.
You don't have to do this.

552
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,720
You don't have to do this!

553
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,280
(Totti) The kids.

554
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,760
(Repice) You have to get out now!

555
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,280
The game must finish, absolutely.

556
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,520
(Totti) Buffon was left wearing only his underwear.

557
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,160
(Repice) The game must end
regularly, otherwise it's the end.

558
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
Antonioli doesn't even have shoes.

559

We see Capello

560
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,200
in his most bitter expression
in the entire season.

561
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,920
(Totti) If we couldn’t continue while Juve is winning 4-0,
the Scudetto would go to Juve.

562
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,600
The fourth world war would happen.

Get out! Get out of the pitch!

565
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,480
The stadium looks normal again.

566
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,000
The referee has resumed the match.

567
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,160
(Totti) By now we were at the end.

568
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,440
(Repice) The final whistle!

569
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,120
Final whistle!

They are the champions!
The champions! The champions!

The champions in 1942. The champions in 1983.

572
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:24,280
The champions today. 17 June 2001.

00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,800
(Totti) I took a risk.

00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,800
I couldn't take the subway.

575
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,680
Just to return to the locker room,
it took me one good hour.

(Totti) This is why I have always said
than winning one scudetto with Roma,

598
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
it's like winning ten scudetti
with the other Italian teams.

You celebrate it for one day. In the same evening.

that we are passionate,

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,240
every day is a party.
It never stops.

607
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,640
if we won the Scudetto
she would get undressed and striptease.

608
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,560
In the end she put on a bikini.

609
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,840
There never really was striptease.

614
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,240
(Totti) The summer after the Scudetto
I rented a yacht.

615
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,600
A week with close friends,

616
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,280
In Sardinia.

617
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,720
There was my cousin Angelo,
who was a point of reference for me .

618
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,120
We call him Pisolo
because he falls asleep everywhere.

619

He is an angel who has fallen to earth.

Giancarlo for us is ‘the Black one’,

621
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,920
because he has the darkest skin of us all.

And he is my right hand.

00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,680
He is a part of my body.

624
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,560
As soon as we got on the boat,

625
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,040
the first thing Angelo did
was mounting his Roma flag.

626
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,000
Do you see the tattoos?

627
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,200
We made a bet

628
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,480
that if we won the Scudetto,
we would get these tattoos.

629
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,800
Unfortunately, we did.

630
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,280
I am not particularly fond of tattoos.

631
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,560
The following year, at the start of the new championship,

632
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,560
President Sensi gave me the best gift.

633
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,680
As his first transfer,
he bought Antonio Cassano from Bari.

634
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:57,040
He was a young talent
with a very high potential.

635
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,520
When he arrived in Rome,
I invited him to my house.

636
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,080
And he became like a younger brother to me.

637
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,600
He lived right with us.

638
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,800
We went out, we joked,
we laughed, we had fun.

639
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,720
We spoke the same language with our feet.

640
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,640
We played with our eyes closed.

641
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,640
We entered into a symbiosis phase, on everything.

642
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,920
We became one.

643
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,600
It looked as if the opposition players disappeared.

644
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,480
It is as if they were made of glass.
We just went inside.

645
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,480
Even though we were 50 meters apart,

646
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,640
the first thought was to find Antonio,
or to find Francesco.

647
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,520
Did you know that by
giving the ball to him, or to me,

648
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,280
the ball is guaranteed inside the net.

649
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,320
He is like that. He talks a lot. He is cheerful.

650
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,920
He's an asshole.
He is not ashamed of anything.

651
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,400
Let's tell the truth,

652
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,120
When you stay in one place all the time
It stings you. It kills you.

653
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,080
But having known him then,

654
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,480
he is one of the best guys out there

655
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,680
in the world of football.

656
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:48,480
We're talking about
when I was 20, 22, 23 years old.

657
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,720
Roma captain. Young,

658
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,880
Single. I had the world in my hand
in that moment.

659
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,320
I used to do fireworks..

660
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,720
I should not think about a girl, shouldn’t I?

661
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,480
And instead..

662
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,680
(together) # I wanna be
the sunshine in your eyes #

663
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,320
# I wanna be the lifelong shooting star #

664
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,560
(Totti) When I saw Ilary on TV, I said:

665
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,800
"That's the woman of my life.
I have to marry that one. "

666
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,320
A friend of mine knew his sister, Silvia.

667
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,880
After two or three months of dating,
we weren't together yet.

668
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,880
And then came that blessed derby.

669
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,600


670
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:41,440
(Totti) I told her:
"Come and see the game"

671
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,040
She had never seen the derby in the stadium.

672
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,640
She had never even been to the stadium.

673
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,080
(Tecca) The spring derby
between Roma and Lazio

674
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,920
in front of 75,000 spectators

675
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,320
in a scenario of lights. The sounds and colors
are really amazing.

676
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,480
Only the Olimpico.

677
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,440
(Totti) I talked with Giancarlo and Angelo, and I said:

678
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,320
"If she comes,
I have to make a shirt for her."

679
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,520
We started thinking
what to write, what to do.

680
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:13,360
A drawing, a writing? In the front of the shirt?
At the back? Red? Yellow?

681
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,480
What do we write? "I love you" ?
No, scrap that, we're not even together yet.

682
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,920
Do you see it here?

683
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,840
Under the Roma jersey,
I have a white shirt with a writing.

684
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,440
If I hadn't scored,
no one would have seen it.

685
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,200
(Totti) Totti, beautiful ball.

686
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,120
Again for Vincent Candela,
inside the penalty area, goal!

687
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,640
Goal! Goal! Goal!

688
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,640
What a great goal! What a great goal!

689
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,440
Totti again.
He gets rid of four opponents,

690
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,680
He shoots! Blocked by Peruzzi
Nesta. He shoots, goal!

691
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,720
Goal! Goal! Montella!

692
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,160
Montella!

693
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,680
What a cross from the Roma captain. Goal!

694
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,440
And it's the third goal! And it's the third goal!
Vincenzo again!

695
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,160
Just outside the penalty box. He shoots. Goal!

696
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,480
Goal!

697
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,040
Goal!

698
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,200
(Totti) 20 minutes before the end
and having made three assists,

699
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,840
I thought: “Looks like it's going to end and
I will not be able to show her my shirt.”

700
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,240
(Zampa) Samuel, Vincent Candela,
excellent tandem with Montella again.

701
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,360
Let’s go, Francesco!

702
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,440
Here is Totti, Totti, Totti. Pallonetto!
Is it going in? Goal!

703
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,880
Goal, Checco. Goal!

704
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,440
Goal, Checco. Goal!

705
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,920
Mamma mia!

706
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,120
(Totti) It was one of the best goals
in my career.

707
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,360
Pallonetto.

708
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,200
Under the Roma jersey,
there was the "6 Unica” shirt (Sei Unica - You’re unique)

709
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,720
If I hadn't scored,
maybe I wouldn't even be together with Ilary.

710
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,600
That is destiny.

711
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,120
It’s all written.

712
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,680
I have never followed football,
I don't understand anything.

713
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:59,320
It is clear that knowing Francesco,
I became interested a little more.

714
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,360
I am pleased to...

715
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,440
A passion for football is growing.

716
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,640
Eh, just a little.

717
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,720
Why is it that we have more and more frequent
of this kind of couples?

718
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,000
Show girls being together with footballers?

719
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,640
(Totti) At that moment, there were
a few pairs of showgirls and footballers.

720
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,000
All gossips.

721
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,640
Together only for two months,
three months, one year,

722
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,480
then they broke up.

723
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,880
90% of the time it was like that.

724
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:35,880
Instead, thank God
we are still together today.

725
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,560
There is chemistry between us. There is everything.

726
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,600
There is respect.

727
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,440
She helped me grow.
That is for sure.

728
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,040
She is also lucky to have me though.

729
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,560
(INAUDIBLE VOICES)

730
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:14,240
(Totti) We couldn't do many things

731
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,640
that a 20 year old did.
Or a 25 year old, a 30 year old.

732
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,560
- (Man) You're great!
- (Man 2) You're great, France!

733
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:29,480
(Totti) Unfortunately you lost some things

734
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:35,280
Things that when you were growing up,
you wanted to do.

735
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,720
(Together) Ilary! Ilary! Ilary!

736
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,360
(Woman) Francesco! Francesco!

737
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,840
(VOICES)

738
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,000
(Totti) But in the end
love prevailed over everything.

739
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,160
That year was a total disaster.

740
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,160
Roma had four different managers.

741
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,320
Many players were injured.
The results did not come.

742
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,800
There was a risk that Roma
could be relegated to Serie B.

743
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,040
Once I went under the curva

744
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,080
because a captain
should calm down its fans.

745
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,720
Suddenly a water bottle hit me.

746
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,840
I would have hit back and might have killed someone.

747
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:52,400
The fact that I grew up in the curva,
I tried to suppress those feelings..

748
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,640
The temptation was strong at that time.

749
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,040
Real Madrid wanted me at all costs.

750
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,760
They were offering me 12 billion a year.

751
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:10,720
When we played against them,
they had Beckham, Raúl, Zidane.

752
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:16,280
Either jokingly or actually telling the truth,
they said:

753
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:20,760
“We heard there is a possibility you could play for us.”

754
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,480
"Hurry up, because Real Madrid
is Real Madrid. "

755
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,560
"No other clubs are
stronger than this club."

756
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,840
Of course, I started to have some doubts.

757
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,720
My relationship with Roma was almost over.

758
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,840
People who are close and trustworthy to me,
told me:

759
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,720
"Listen, Roma is Roma, ok, but ..."

760
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,920
"Do you think about it too?"

761
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,480
Everyone would gladly welcome me in Madrid.

762
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,640
Even Ilary also gave her permission.

763
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,480
She said: "This is an opportunity for you
that will hardly happen again."

764
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,200
(Priest) At that time,
some Pharisees approached Jesus,

765
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,880
to test him, and then they asked him:

766
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,760
"It is lawful for a man to divorce
his wife for any reason? "

767
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,640
Jesus said "For this man,
he will leave his father and mother,"

768
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:18,480
"will join his wife
and the two will be one flesh."

769
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,880
"What God has joined,
don't let man part."

770
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,440
Word of the Lord.

771
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,840
(NOISES OF JUBILATION)

772
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,520
(APPLAUSE)

773

00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,440
(Totti) Where am I going? How could I leave Roma?

779
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,800
It is unthinkable. It’s impossible.

780
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,760
I'm from Rome and that's it.

781
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,680
Mamma mia. How beautiful Rome is.

782
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,600
I don't know many places in Rome,
because I cannot go out.

783
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,480
Why ? Because I cannot.

784
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,680
I cannot stay undisturbed for long.
It took one minute to look at a monument

785
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,480
And half an hour to sign autographs.

786
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,680
What am I enjoying?

787
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,360
In the end I am a human being.

788
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,600
People don't understand this.

789
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,520
Now they see you
from another point of view.

790
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,320
I am no longer Francesco.

791
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,280
I have also become a monument.

792
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,760
(INAUDIBLE VOICES)

793
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,360
(Totti) I would like to be invisible.

794
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,720
I hope, before I die,

795
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,080
I could spend a day
without being approached for a photo or an autograph.

796
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:23,000
Without people stopping you,
looking at you and greeting you.

797
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,800
For one day,
I would like to be a normal person.

798
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,480
Will there be such a day before I die?
For me, no.

799
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,120
But in the end
it's like you know everyone.

800
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,080
What I have experienced,
with the people of Rome,

801
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,760
Nobody else in the world has experienced it.

802
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,320
I wanted to marry this project
because it's important.

803
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:53,720
It is important to both us the players
and for the club and for all the fans.

804
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,080
(Testa) So far Totti,
on the day of the signing

805
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,480
of his virtually lifelong contract
with Roma.

806
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,800
(Totti) Do you know who went to Real Madrid?

807
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,520
Him

808
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,520
Look how he dressed!

809
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,800
Luciano Spalletti
is the new Roma manager.

810
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,080
(Totti) At that moment,

811
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,640
Spalletti was the right coach
to make the leap in quality.

812
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:24,480
Then, as he always said,
it was a dream for him to train me.

813
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,880
There is some space, Checco! There is some space!

814
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,560
(Totti) I really had
good times with him.

815
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:40,160
That period was extraordinary for me.
Truly beautiful.

816
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,840
Cristian was born in November.

817
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,880
Holding a baby in your arm. Just the look, the smell...

818
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,280
With Spalletti we had won
nine consecutive matches.

819
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,000
We had to get the tenth,

820
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,640
which in Italy would be the most consecutive wins in
the championship.

821
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,640
Then, in June,
the World Cup began.

822
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,680
Mentally, I was more charged
and more motivated than the usual.

823
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,920
I felt strong.

824
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:22,880
Everyone wanted to break the record,
especially myself.

825
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,040
Instead, nothing happened.

826
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,840
Destiny destroyed everything.

827
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,440
(WHISTLES)

828
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,200
(WHISTLES)

829
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,320
(Totti) I realized immediately
the extent of the injury.

830
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,640
In the end, when I was holding my ankle,

831
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,920
I took my hand away and everything went down.

832
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,560
When he tackled me from behind,
he broke the nerve.

833
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,600
Ouch!

834
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,600
(Totti) The ankle
turned backwards.

835
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,040
Both the ligaments of my ankle were broken.

836
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,640
Not to mention the fracture of the fibula.

837
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,440
With an injury like this,

838
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,480
80% of the players
would stop playing.

839
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:50,120
As soon as I was at the hospital, I did MRI scan

840
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,040
I talked to the doctor and he told me:
"We will do the surgery immediately."

841
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,320
"Prof, I will have the surgery if you give me
the chance to go to the World Cup. "

842
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,520
"If not, I won't have surgery."

843
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,440
I was afraid.

844
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,160
I am afraid of everything.

845
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,600
Professor Mariani told me:

846
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:18,600
"I guarantee,  if you have the surgery immediately,
you’ll have a chance for the World Cup. "

847
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,720
Then he put me asleep and ...

848
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:25,920
The day after,
without me knowing anything,

849
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,080
- (Journalist) Mister!
- (Totti) Lippi comes to the clinic.

850
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,480
(Journalist) How was Totti's condition?

851
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,640
Very very good,
very peaceful, very calm.

852
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,160
Very positive.

853
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,480
- (Journalist 2) Did he say something
in particular ? - No.

854
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:44,200
(Totti) He told me:
"I'll be waiting for you until the end."

855
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,720
"Even with one leg,
I want you 100%. "

856
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,640
"You are the one
that will make us win the World Cup."

857
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,560
I see him after the surgery

858
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:04,040
It made me happy.
It gave me something more.

859
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:12,080
From there, the struggles for Germany began.

860
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,840
- (Totti) Mario.
- I'll do it.

861
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,400
My grandfather had a wooden leg.

862
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,560
I swear to you, a wooden leg.

863
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,800
- (Man) Did they have it amputated?
- Yes

864
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,480
My mother was there in the evening. Every evening,

865
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,240
He went to his room, took it off
and put his wooden leg behind the door.

866
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,760
I swear to you on my mother, not a joke.

867
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,440
- Now I’m asking, because this ...
- What, am I telling you bullshit?

868
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,880
My grandfather, oh.

869
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,360
Did you know my Grandpa
only had one leg?

870
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,600
- (Man 2) The left or the right leg?
- The left one.

871
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,920
He didn't have his left leg, like me

872
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,800
Daje, Grandpa

# One Captain. There is only one captain.

Push, go, move.

Go, push. One two three four...

879
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:19,520
(Totti) I passed
three really tough months.

880
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,360
I lost seven, eight kilos,

881
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,160
training every day.

882
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,360
Four hours training in the morning
and four hours in the afternoon is a lot.

883
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,680
I lost my strength. I had lost everything.

884
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,240
But then people transmitted
their strength to me.

885
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:54,440
People who were looking for everything
to bring home the result,

886
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,920
to get me to the World Cup.

887
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:09,280
(CROWD NOISES)

888
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:19,320
(Totti) After a month,
I removed the nail and the brace.

889
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,920
I start walking again.

890
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,800
After two months, I started running.

891
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,880
In a month I had to do everything.

892
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,720
Then the World Championship began.

893
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,680
Spalletti is the one
who was very close to me.

894
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,480
(Scala) Go, bring it to me, Lucia ',
bring it to me, go, son of the wind!

895
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:46,880
(Totti) After the training was over,
he came to train with me.

896
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:51,560
He joked. He laughed.
We had a good relationship, at that time.

897
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,040
Then I received the call from mister
Lippi.

898
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:05,880
He visited me
to really see how I was doing.

899
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,680
He told me: "So?"

"How are you? How are we doing?"

901
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,800
I told him:

01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,720
"I'm ready.

01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,240
"I’m at your disposal."

to charity ... - What a drag.

Pirlo is free. He could shoot.

- (Caressa) He hit it with his left foot!

- Schwarzer blocked it with his feet!
- (Totti) Instead, it became complicated.

(Caressa) Toni!  On the bottom !

917
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:31,920
(Totti) Before the match, the manager asked me and said:

918
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,680
"You're not playing today. I’ll let you rest."

919
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:36,920
I was frustrated.

Then, at some point,
we were playing only with ten players.

I hadn’t thought he would sub me in
with fifteen minutes left.

01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:51,120
(Caressa) We still have 15 minutes left.

Totti with a long ball to the left.

924
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,400
Grosso passed the ball.

01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,800
There is room for a cross.

Trying to attack the space,
Grosso is in the penalty box.

When I was walking, Pirlo turned towards me, saying:

933
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,080
"Daje, score this one, please."

934
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:36,080
Then some of my team mates went to my right for a drink,
some went to my left ...

935
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,480
They all went away.

936
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:44,040
Eventually I walked straight ahead

937
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,440
up to the penalty spot.

938
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:52,720
It was 20 seconds of anguish.

939
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,240
I knew I must not miss this.

940
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,160
We were only playing with 10 players.

941
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,080
If I scored, the game was over.

942
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:08,640
If I didn’t, we would have gone to extra time, and we’d have been defeated,

943
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,320
because we couldn't take it anymore.

944
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,640
I had everything on my feet.

945
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,920
When I have everything on my feet,

946
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,880
it’s difficult to miss.

947
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,920
(NOISES OF JUBILATION)

948
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,800
(Totti) I was sure that the ball would go in.

949
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,920
(Caressa) It's over!

950
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,000
This is a sign of destiny.

951
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:51,200
Totti took us to the second round in the first game he didn't play.

952
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:54,440
(Totti) It looks like bullshit, but in the end, it is real.

01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,480

Thanks, Totti!

957

- Come on Totti! Come on Italy! - Come on Italy!

958
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:18,000
(Caressa) Totti on the counterattack.
Passing the ball to Gilardino.

959
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:22,560
Gilardino, to Del Piero, Del Piero, Goal!

(Caressa) Let's go to Berlin, Beppe!

962
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,080
(Totti) This is the final against France.

963
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,160
We were on top of the world.

964
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,840
- (Caressa) It's a goal. - (Bergomi) It's a goal.

965
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,920
(Totti) It happens once in a lifetime.

966
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,920
(Caressa) France were ahead.

967
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,120
(Totti) But we were a strong, united group.

968
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,160
We were all opponents, in our respective clubs.

969
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:05,480
At the same time, these are the same people

970
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,080
who have always played together from Under15 to the national team.

971

You grew up with them.

972

Sure, people would tell you about some episodes.

pushed you to raise this trophy.

I tell you the truth,

983
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,040

01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:10,200
(Cucchi) Impressive, Roma have crushed Inter.

998
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,320
(Totti) Lots of things have happened.

999
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:21,520
We have won two Italian Cups and a Super Cup.

1000
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:24,920
(Sparta) Totti strikes, goal!

1001
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:30,080
(Totti) We changed coach. We got up there in the standings.

1002
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:34,360
And then each time, at the decisive moment, we collapsed.

1003
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,880
(Longhi) Resounding defeat.

1004

(Totti) Second best forever, as we always said.

1005
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:45,720
Then I won the Golden Boot as European top scorer.

1006

It's not cheap.

1007
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,200
My game was always like that.

1008
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,440
Entertaining people.

1009
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,200
My strengths are:

1010
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,280
physical power ...

1011
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,080
(Zampa) Totti in the penalty area!

1012
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,640
(Totti) My deadly right foot.

1013
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,880
Technical skills

1014
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,480
And instinct.

1015
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,280
(Zampa) Totti's splendid touch.

1016
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,840
(Paw) Chest strike, flying dribble, long ball for Batistuta!

1017
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,200
(Totti) My weak point?
My touchiness.

1018
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,920
When I lose or fail to do something, I lash out too much.

1019
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:30,240
When this happens, it could become nasty.

1020
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,600
One thing that I am ashamed of.

1021
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,640
But in the end I am a good [person.

1022
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,680
I am closed, reserved, shy.

1023
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:45,040
I am a romantic.

1024
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:49,000
But when I was on the pitch, I transformed.

1025
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:55,000
(Pizzul) And he scores! Totti risked to do the impossible!

1026
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,920
(Totti) I leave Francesco behind ...

1027
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,800
and I become Totti.

1028
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,840
Totti has what it takes in there.

1029
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,040
I’ll tell you the truth.

1030
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,560
Now, look at some of these clips,

1031
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:15,200
You see that when I was 25 or 30 and I was a professional footballer,

1032
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,840
I still did the same things I did as a child.

1033
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,520
I already had that thing.

1034
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,440
Now I realize it,

1035
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,200
after a career of 30 years.

1036
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,000
Then boom, suddenly ...

1037
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,240
France'.

1038
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,120
(Totti) I’m 40.

1039
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,320
Forty birthdays. Happy Birthday, friend !

1040
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,200
You're getting old, huh?

1041
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,280
You can play another five years, for what you have shown us.

1042
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,640
(Totti) It is normal for the body to change at 40.

1043
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,920
But physically I was fine.

1044
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:03,360
(NOISES OF JUBILATION)

1045
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,680
(Totti) My physical condition
was due to one person.

1046
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,880
You saw him here,

1047
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,720
He always stood next to me.

1048
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,520
But you didn't realise.

1049
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,360
Here he is, Vito Scala.

1050
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,040
Here you can see well.

1051
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:30,800
This is him.

1052
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,360
That's him, too.

1053
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,560
Look, rewind.

1054
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,800
Look at Vito's face.

1055
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:45,680
There he is.

1056
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,840
He’s here aswell.

1057
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:51,920
Always next to me.

1058
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,040
Vito was everything for me.

1059
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,320
(Totti) Looks like I don't have the strength,
how is it?

1060
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,720
- You have the strenght.
- Do I?

1061
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,480
(Totti) He managed me, he gave me advice,

1062
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,840
took care of me down to the details,
the particulars.

1063
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,920
(Scala) Tonight rich dinner,
protein load,

1064
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,880
game and bedtime.

1065
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,440
Tomorrow morning, an eggnog.

1066
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,920
(Totti) As if he was
an older brother.

1067
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:24,160
(Totti) Take this silhouette back,
here, look.

1068
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,480
(Totti) We made the same journey.

1069
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,440
We joined Roma at the same time.

1070
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,440
When I was 12 years old, he arrived.

1071
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,600
We grew together.

1072
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:42,120
He was a physical coach
on the team.

1073
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:46,720
Then he became my personal,
after I became captain.

1074
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:51,120
Vito, always standing next to me,

1075
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,360
saw the beautiful and ugly of me.

1076
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,320
This is one of the ugliest.

1077
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,200
I'm sorry.

1078
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,400
You know me, what I’m like

1079
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:19,680
Francesco, at the age of 40 years,
had learned so many things.

1080
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:28,160
As a man, he managed to realize
the dream he had always desired, right?

1081
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:34,240
A family, children,
like a normal person.

1082
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,080
Oh!

1083
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:43,640
(Totti) I've had all the people
that have always stood by me.

1084
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,520
Friends, cousins.

1085
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,200
Ilary.

1086
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:54,600
That for me is the most beautiful victory,
the greatest victory.

1087
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,440
We grew up.

1088
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:01,640
The children were raised.

1089
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,160
Yay!

1090
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,200
(Totti) A lot of things changed,

1091
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,600
But the friendships
Always remained the same,

1092
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,440
the intact one, the real one,

1093
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:16,200
the one to believe in eternally.

1094
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:25,240
So I was glad I could close
my career with a friend.

1095
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,640
(fans) Luciano Spalletti eh eh oh oh

1096
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:30,920
(fans) Luciano Spalletti eh eh oh oh

1097
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,680
(Totti) He had helped me so much
in difficult times,

1098
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:37,040
after the injury.

1099
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,320
I was sure
that it could end in a beautiful way.

1100
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:43,480
I knew him,
He wanted to come back at all costs.

1101
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,480
We had a great relationship.

1102
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:48,680
But then, when he came...

1103
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:49,720
Hi.

1104
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,800
(Totti) It turned out
the complete opposite.

1105
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,360
Something was different
I saw it since day one.

1106
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:07,720
I could see it when he said hello
with “good morning” and “good evening”.

1107
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,720
Before, he never said
“good morning” and “good evening” to me.

1108
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,720
He would say: [Jokingly] “You asshole, come here.“

1109
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,440
He liked me so much that,
He wouldn't even call me by name.

1110
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:22,400
Any coach, the first person
He talks to is the captain.

1111
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:25,360
He asks: “What's the locker room like?
Why didn’t you win?”

1112
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:29,280
In fact, he called everyone else
and and not me.

1113
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:34,320
When I came home, Ilary would say to me,

1114
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,640
“Are you sure
that you didn't do anything to him?“

1115
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,160
“Maybe you offended him...“

1116
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,480
"Me?"

1117
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:44,480
I could see he excluded me.

1118
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,600
He didn't consider me.

1119
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:51,440
He let me make one or two appearances
of ten minutes each.

1120
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:57,640
Then against Sassuolo he tells me to warm up
where there were ten minutes left.

1121
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:58,840
To do what?

1122
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,280
In that moment the anger, the irritation...

1123
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,880
There was a kid looking at me.

1124
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,920
He was like Cristian, the same age.

1125
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:13,320
I told him: “Let's do some keepy uppies,
let me see if you're capable.“

1126
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,680
“Why was I going to come on anyways,
to take the applause?“

1127
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,040
“I don't need applause.“

1128
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,840
During training
He only gave a hard time to me.

1129
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:26,440
He came up with reasons
to give me a hard time.

1130
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,040
He used to scold me in front of everyone.

1131
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:31,200
Not that he shouldn’t have told me off,
There is way and way.

1132
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,200
He was only doing it with me, with others he didn't.

1133
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,920
Something was wrong.

1134
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,560
Earthquake in Roma after Spallettis decision
to not call up Totti.

1135
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:48,520
(Grimaldi) After the outburst at TG1
of the giallorossi captain,

1136
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:52,560
Spalletti excludes him from the squad
for the game with Palermo.

1137
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,760
(Totti) He told me, “It’s not acceptable.“

1138
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:00,440
“You do as you please,
you've always done as you please.“

1139
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,440
“You were going to play,
But now I won't play you today.“

1140
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,000
“You are not called up.“

1141
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,760
“What do you mean I'm not called up?“

1142
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,520
“If you want, you can leave.“

1143
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,880
I mean, are you kicking me out from Trigoria?

1144
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:19,880
From my home?

1145
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:26,920
(Commentator) Roma fans,
wellcome back to the Stadio Olimpico.

1146
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,200
(Totti) A player goes to the stadium
even if he doesn't play.

1147
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:34,480
I didn't really want to go that night.

1148
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:40,240
Then Ilary told me: “No, you will go.“

1149
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:42,920
“In fact, we will all go, if not I'll leave you.“

1150
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,520
(Speaker) Coach: Luciano Spalletti!

1151
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,840
(WHISTLES)

1152
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:02,480
(CROWD NOISE)

1153
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,440
(PROTESTING VOICES)

1154
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:20,640
(Spalletti) I can't accept that one
says these things before a game,

1155
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:26,520
and says these things after a run
of victories as the team has had.

1156
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,160
I have to manage a team.

1157
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,600
I have to respect all 25,
not just one.

1158
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,840
(Totti) There has been
a total estrangement.

1159
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,600
For me he didn't exist anymore.

1160
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,840
He was the coach, but he no longer existed.

1161
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:52,160
(Man) In this case Totti was wrong,
but I can’t say I'm against Totti

1162
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,160
(Man 2) Totti is the symbol of Roma.

1163
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,280
(Woman) You can't kick someone like Totti.

1164
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:59,600
(Man 3) You must play whoever is better,
who is more in form.

1165
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:03,040
(Woman 2) As I see it,
neither is wrong or right.

1166
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:12,880
(Totti) I could have very well decided
to retire that year.

1167
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
But for me it was hard to think that.

1168
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:26,240
I could see that, during practice,
I didn't struggle compared to the others.

1169
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,920
Why do I have to quit,
if I'm still okay?

1170
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,280
Why do I have to feel bad afterwards and say:
“Fuck, why did I quit?“

1171
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,800
He saw it, when I was training,

1172
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,680
that compared to the others
I was also a little better.

1173
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:46,320
But he never took you
in consideration,

1174
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:50,480
in fact, he used to make you play two or three minutes
knowing that you couldn't do anything anyway.

1175
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,920
(Commentator) There is the goal for Bologna.

1176
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,800
Bologna are in the lead.

1177
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:06,520
 (Totti) Chance, Gods will,
desperation,

1178
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,280
Because that is what matters,

1179
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:16,160
the moment you need a change,
who made that change?

1180
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:18,680
Io.

1181
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,560
(Commentator) Ball to Salah, Salah, goal!

1182
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,280
1-1!

1183
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,120
(Spalletti) I take him in consideration.
I treat him like a real footballer.

1184
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:33,480
I am one of the few
who treats him like a real footballer.

1185
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,720
(Commentator) Borriello...
Borriello scores.

1186
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,120
3-2 for Atalanta.

1187
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,760
Come on guys!

1188
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:46,280
Shot comes in, the ball is still there.

1189
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,040
The strike... Mamma mia!

1190
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,080
Totti shoots.

1191
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:54,880
Goal ! It’s him!
The captain finds the goal to make it 3-3!

1192
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:58,120
Spalletti wants to immediately put the ball
back in the middle.

1193
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:01,920
(Spalletti) Totti didn't save anything.
The team saved the game.

1194
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,120
He scored as he should,
took a shot.

1195
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,200
(Totti) He used to let me
play less and less.

1196
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:14,480
Seven minutes? Six minutes.
Six minutes? Five minutes.

1197
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:18,520
(Zancan) He puts it in low, first post,
Martinez lurkes at the back post!

1198
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,080
He brings the Toro back ahead,
Roma are frozen, 2-1.

1199
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,160
(Totti) In Roma-Torino,

1200
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:29,480
to mess with me
in front of everyone,

1201
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:33,480
He subs me in when it’s 2-1 for Torino,
three minutes from the end.

1202
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,560
What do you expect me to do?

1203
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,800
(Zancan) Listen to the roar from the Roma
 fans for the entrance of Totti.

1204
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,640
(Totti) In two or three minutes,
what can one player do?

1205
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,760
Can I change a game? No.

1206
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,800
Who can do it? None.

1207
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:49,680
How often does that happen?
Once in a hundred million.

1208
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,720
(Zancan) Ball flicked on,
far post!

1209
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:59,400
Immediately Totti's goal. Just subbed on!

1210
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:02,000
His first touch, he flies for the draw!

1211
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:05,880
(Totti) Fatality,
after ten seconds I make it 2-2.

1212
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:11,200
(Marchegiani) This
is an amazing story.

1213
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,400
(Zancan) He only needed
a second to make an impact.

1214
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,280
The ball comes in...

1215
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:20,480
Maybe another handball.

1216
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,480
Penalty kick for Roma!

1217
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:27,120
(Totti) After two minutes
he gives the penalty kick.

1218
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,200
(Zancan) Two minutes until the end,
Totti vs. Padelli.

1219
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,600
(WHISTLE)

1220
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:45,200
(Zancan) Totti! 3-2!

1221
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,840
He turned the game around!
Francesco Totti!

1222
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:50,800
Unbelievable.

1223
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:55,720
(INAUDIBLE VOICES)

1224
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,600
(Marchegiani) I don't know if this has
ever happened in football history

1225
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:08,720
that a player scored two goals
touching the ball twice.

1226
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:12,680
(Zancan) Cameras picking up
Spalletti.

1227
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,840
(Totti) Ilary told me the next day:

1228
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:21,440
“Retire, everything you had to do,
you did.“

1229
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,520
But nothing, another year,
another contract,

1230
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,360
Because nobody wanted to do it to me.

1231
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:30,480
Do I sign?

1232
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:35,600
(Totti) That extra year,
It got even worse.

1233
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:40,280
From December to March
he never played me.

1234
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:45,480
The first game he made me play
was Roma-Sampdoria,

1235
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,480
when there was the great flood.

1236
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:52,200
At the end of the first half he told me:
“Warm up, you’ll enter right away.“

1237
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:54,880
I said: “Sure...“

1238
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:59,080
From there, mentally, I let go.

1239
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,280
Here we go.

1240
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,880
This is the night
that we never wanted to end.

1241
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:29,560
And you, Roma, what are you doing? Are you sleeping?

1242
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:38,720
(SONG: ANIMA CHRISTI”
OF THE CHOIR OF THE ROMAN DIOCESE)

1243
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:08,640
(Totti) This time has passed.

1244
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:11,400
For you as well, though.

1245
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,760
(Ilary) Good morning.

1246
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,680
Ao.

1247
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:41,800
What are you doing?

1248
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:03,840
(Ilary) Bye, love.

1249
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:29,920
- (Totti) Hello.
Hi.

1250
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,840
How do I do it?
Huh?

1251
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:35,040
How do I do it?
- (Totti) What is this, a funeral?

1252
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,520
France', score today, huh.

1253
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,160
- Come on, captain.
- We're all there for you.

1254
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,840
- (Man) We love you.
- (Man 2) Thank you for everything.

1255
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:45,040
Thank you.

1256
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:46,760
- (Totti) Hello.
-You're number one.

1257
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:51,680
- Thank you forever, you are number one,
You are the greatest! Bye.

1258
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:55,720
- (Man) Do you know that lady?
- That's Sabrina.

1259
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,280
- She is renowned.
- (Man) Oh yeah?

1260
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:59,200
Yeah!
- (Man) Oh, right.

1261
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:00,440
She was...

1262
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:04,840
in love with Beppe Giannini.

1263
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:09,040
The first fan that was really obsessed.

1264
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:15,920
Oh well.

1265
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,240
(De Rossi) The last entrance!

1266
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,280
Eh?

1267
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:29,840
The last entrance, the last boot...

1268
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:32,880
(Nainggolan) Francesco, sorry,
they stress you already from 3 o'clock

1269
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:35,560
But you have to tell me things.

1270
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,640
(OVERLAPPING VOICES)

1271
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,400
(Man) Bend down.

1272
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,480
(Man 2) There he is!

1273
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,840
(Man 3) He’s not stupid!

1274
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:48,920
(Man 2) Angelo! Angelo! Angelo!

1275
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,080
(together) One captain,
there is only one captain

1276
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,480
One captain

1277
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:56,760
(Man) Come with us!

1278
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:59,600
(together) One captain

(CROWD OVERJOYED)

1280
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,480
(Man) We're all here!

1281
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,880
Grandma Marcella is also here!

1282
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:13,040
- Are you ready?
- Where is Chanel?

1283
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:14,800
Are you ready?

1284
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:17,800
I’m not coming.

1285
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,240
- Scale!
- Go.

1286
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,120
- Scale!
- “Cheese”.

1287
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:25,120
(Totti) They were more emotional than I was.

1288
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:28,800
- Go to the front.
- We’ll fall, Riccardo!

1289
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:30,720
(Totti) This group here,

1290
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:35,800
all the damn Sundays,
Saturdays, Wednesdays we played

1291
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,400
they really always followed me.

1292
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,440
- Where should I look?
- I don't know.

1293
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:42,880
(Totti) Therefore they too,
at that moment, all retired.

1294
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:44,240
- Take the photo.
- Can you take the photo?

1295
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,680
- Break it up.
- Do we have our phone?

1296
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:13,520
(Totti) My father and my mother
didn’t even come to the stadium.

1297
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:19,800
For them it was too hard.

1298
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:26,200
I told them: “You decide,
If you want, I would be happy.“

1299
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:29,560
For me it has always been the same.

1300
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:34,400
Both when I was young and when I’m older,
when you walked into the field

1301
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:38,320
you looked at the stand to see
where your mother and father were.

1302
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:46,800
(Speaker) number 11, Mohammed Salah,
exits the field.

1303
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:56,360
Coming on, the number 10,

1304
01:34:58,160 --> 01:34:59,480

1310
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:48,600
(Totti) So I was there, reflecting.

1311
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:52,480
I was thinking about everything I did,
right things, wrong things.

1312
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:56,080
To myself, I was like,

1313
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:01,240
“It can't be that now I go out
and there's a celebration for me.“

1314
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,160
“It is an unthinkable thing.“

(CROWD NOISE)

1323
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:08,840
(Totti) Everything I learned,
both in football and in life,

1324
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:11,800
I learned it here,
in the courtyard of my school,

1325
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:15,440
with my friends,
between ice creams.

1326
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:18,720
I might be crazy, but I think
that the harder the challenges are,

1327
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:20,240
More you have to take it easy.

1328
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,120
You need to have fun.

1329
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:26,280
Enough about the past, now.

1330
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:32,000
France', you need to know that in front of you

1331
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:37,160
there is a future more beautiful
than you can imagine.

1332
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:48,240
Oh well.

1333
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:51,000
Go back a moment.
