1
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,310
A SERBIAN FILM

2
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,610
Baby,I'm gonna fuck you up

3
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,430
Are you insane? Haven't we agreed about putting away your flicks?

4
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,840
What's that? Give it to mommy.

5
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,480
Sorry, but it's not a big deal.

6
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,820
I saw my first porn when I was his age.

7
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,240
How are you, kiddo?

8
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,120
But your dad wasn't starring in it!

9
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,340
Maria, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

10
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,140
I dug up that DVD

11
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,360
because Laylah called and wanted to see me today.

12
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,320
Baby, you want mommy to make you a toast?

13
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,720
The jumping bread!

14
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,780
Mom, what was dad doing there?

15
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,800
Nothing, hon. Just playing with a girl friend.

16
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,260
It's like a cartoon for the grownups.

17
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,370
Honey, I have to pay for Petar's singing lessons.

18
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,360
- Bye,dad. - Bye,dad.

19
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,900
Easy on that whiskey. Rye kills sexual appetite.

20
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,900
That's why I drink it.

21
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,440
- So, how's family life? - Nice.

22
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,040
How are Petar and... Maria?

23
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,420
Yes, Maria. They're fine.

24
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,000
Next year Petar's starting school.

25
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,580
It'll be interesting when they

26
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,580
ask about his father's occupation.

27
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,370
His father is a fine gentleman in a premature retirement.

28
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,950
The problem with that pension is that it's not lifelong.

29
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,780
How much do you have stashed? 5 or 10 grand?

30
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,120
Milos, you were more than just a porn star, you were an artist.

31
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,400
All actresses you worked with wanted to marry you.

32
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,700
You're still an artist, but with a temporary block.

33
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,830
And I'm your guardian angel.

34
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,000
Listen.

35
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,930
Something big is about to happen.

36
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,740
Artistic pornography of the highest level.

37
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,290
Here, in Serbia.

38
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,700
In Serbia?

39
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,610
Only filmed here, but for the foreign market.

40
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,090
Terribly professional. Phenomenally paid.

41
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,050
If you accept

42
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,040
your family will be settled

43
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,400
till the end of Petar's life.

44
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,920
The man's name is Vukmir.

45
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,180
He'll call you in a few days.

46
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,410
Be nice to him.

47
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,060
Here's something for the junior.

48
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,370
Wow, where's his pussy?

49
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,960
You didn't tell me you brought your copper bro to the meeting.

50
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,290
I came on my own.

51
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,810
I knew you'd be sitting here

52
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,840
and couldn't miss a chance to see you.

53
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,010
I'm your great admirer.

54
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,420
You're well preserved.

55
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,000
Who's the plastic surgeon we have to thank to?

56
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,240
You know I started early.

57
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,980
I don't need plastic yet.

58
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,340
Everybody needs it.

59
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,820
These don't.

60
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,170
So long, fags. Milos, you heard my advice.

61
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,500
- A hooker! - A porn star.

62
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,060
Has-been.

63
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,000
You know the kind of work she did after you married?

64
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,840
I know.

65
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,010
No one could handle a dick like she could.

66
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,260
A natural talent.

67
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,410
Funny she hasn't contacted her dealer in the past few years.

68
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,880
Is she off drugs?

69
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,000
Doubtful.

70
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,440
A new,

71
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,060
rich provider, more likely.

72
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,180
You'll alienate me from my friends if you keep checking on them.

73
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,600
Friends, in Serbia?

74
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,730
You can't check them enough.

75
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,560
I got to go.

76
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,800
Say hello to your kid and his beautiful mom.

77
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,840
I'm paying for the bite.

78
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,010
- So long. - Bye.

79
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,620
Sleeping time, hands up.

80
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,890
- Dad? - Yes?

81
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,010
Know that friend of yours, that you were beating in the video?

82
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,380
It's only a movie.

83
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,220
Make believe. When dad was young.

84
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,010
I know, but while I was watching it

85
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,180
- I felt something strange. - What?

86
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,280
Like some kind of a wheel, spinning.

87
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,770
A wheel? Where?

88
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,300
Down there, near my willie.

89
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,100
Several of them,

90
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,560
like a family, traveling.

91
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,890
Do they live in me?

92
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,640
They do, hun, in all of us. We all have them.

93
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,120
- Everyone in the world? - Yes, everyone.

94
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,090
They're gone now so close your eyes,

95
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,020
think of them and you'll fall asleep faster.

96
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,760
What language is that?

97
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,740
I'm translating for some Swedes.

98
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,160
Swedish? I'm great in it.

99
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,260
[in Swedish]

100
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,300
That's right.

101
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,810
Wait, I know more. Listen to this.

102
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,360
[in Swedish]

103
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,050
You would be a mega star.

104
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,440
So, you say Laylah is offering you a serious job?

105
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,800
So she said.

106
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,040
It's strange.

107
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,680
Why would anyone offer me big money

108
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,580
after such a long pause?

109
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,760
In Serbia?

110
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,020
And after all the crap I shot, look at this.

111
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,910
Maybe they need the only porn star with a university diploma.

112
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,400
Do you miss it?

113
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,600
- What? -The job.

114
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,890
I don't know. No.

115
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,440
I miss the money so we could escape away from here.

116
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
All those poor girls you threw away like condoms...

117
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,370
How come you've never done me like them?

118
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,410
Well, I love you. Them, I only fucked.

119
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,330
Does it mean that you never wanted to fuck me?

120
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,960
Am I talking to the Balkan sex god,

121
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,890
Nikola Tesla of world pornography?

122
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,450
- You must be Vukmir? - Of course.

123
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,080
Milos, if you're ready to change your life

124
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,540
right now and provide for your family for good

125
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,780
a car will be waiting at your door in 30 minutes.

126
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:23,700
You just hop in, and take a ride towards fulfillment

127
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,640
of your personal and my professional fantasies.

128
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,410
Can't wait to meet you!

129
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,020
I'm honored to shake the hands of such a great artist, I'm Vukmir.

130
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,420
I'm Miloš, nice to meet you.

131
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,900
The right hand...is the sex center of any man.

132
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,340
It's direct line between your brain and cock.

133
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,400
Ever since your childhood.

134
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,000
Your hand is special

135
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,700
for it has jerked such a special cock.

136
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,080
Miloš.

137
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:27,020
It's an honor to shake the hand of such an artist of fuck.

138
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,290
Pornography is art,

139
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,960
but people can't see that!

140
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,450
Why not?

141
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,760
Because they just want to jizz into a napkin

142
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,570
what they can't into a woman.

143
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,980
These movies are mostly made so that

144
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,050
those who can't get laid can cum.

145
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,210
They're made by butchers

146
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,410
who can't tell a camera from a broom.

147
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,170
Their 'actors' would be fucking a hole

148
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,480
in the wall if there were no pussy.

149
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,200
Do you know what proves that there is art in pornography?

150
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,080
What?

151
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:16,940
You.

152
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,570
You, Miloš.

153
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,620
You are the proof!

154
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,400
Your sense of handling a woman,

155
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,600
 your rhythm of exhausting her,

156
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,010
your talent to humiliate her,

157
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,420
and then, when she is reduced to a dog-shit,

158
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,850
to win her back.

159
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,620
And your love for it, that's art.

160
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,000
Sadly,

161
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,780
this is no country for real art.

162
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,460
Where there is no life, there can't be real art.

163
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,900
A real talent will rot here,

164
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,970
while maggots are giving press conferences.

165
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,700
Have you done anything I could've seen?

166
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,850
I'm doing stuff that no one else is.

167
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,140
Just for the selected clients.

168
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,960
All right, but what is it?

169
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,740
Art, naked art!

170
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,530
Truth.

171
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,200
Real people, real situations, real sex...

172
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,450
minimal editing.

173
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,640
There's a serious script.

174
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,660
We know it,

175
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,720
you don't!

176
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,780
And what am I supposed to do?

177
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,120
The same as always, Miloš.

178
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,810
Just stand before the cameras,

179
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,650
whip out your cock,

180
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,770
and fuck until it's raw.

181
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,520
I dunno, I'm a little tired of cameras and fucking.

182
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,140
You're also tired of humping scum

183
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,290
any time your family needs money.

184
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,080
Kissing some wretched cunts

185
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,980
with the same lips you'd kiss your kid.

186
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,810
Thanks, doctor.

187
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,380
- What's that? - The contract.

188
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,570
No need to read all, just the numbers.

189
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,660
Something wrong?

190
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,060
I don't know what I'm signing, what I'm shooting.

191
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,410
You're not supposed to know.

192
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,410
If you knew, you wouldn't be so good.

193
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:30,010
In a winter night way up the hill.

194
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:36,360
A creek was frozen and covered by the snow.

195
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:43,400
A bunny's weeping for that frozen creek

196
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:49,440
young bunny's crying with all his heart.

197
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:55,800
But poor li'l bunny there upon the hill

198
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:02,860
perhaps hes after the swallows heading for a warmer South.

199
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,610
Vukmir.

200
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,010
Sounds like a name of one of those guys at the Hague tribunal.

201
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,200
Are you sure he's not an arms dealer?

202
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,640
No, he's some kind of an artist philosopher

203
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,520
with a grand plan.

204
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,540
Is it?

205
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,560
I don't know.

206
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,250
But it seems like he desperately needs me

207
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,760
since he's willing to offer so much money.

208
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,680
How much?

209
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,330
I won't tell you.

210
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,910
Yes you will, or I'm not giving it back.

211
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,410
Ok, I'll tell you, just let go.

212
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,460
Don't tell me you refused?

213
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,580
Of course I did.

214
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,000
I wanted to see if you're with me for the money.

215
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,040
If I were, I'd have dumped you for your brother long ago.

216
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,900
So, you prefer poor porn stars to bad cops.

217
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,660
Does it means that I should rent my dick to Vukmir?

218
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,170
Remember what you told me

219
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,370
when I asked if you missed your job?

220
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:53,500
Miloš, I want both of your heads to be clear and hard.

221
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,500
If it's true...

222
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,370
If what is true?

223
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,490
That you were always able to have it erected

224
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,000
without touching or looking.

225
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,800
Like a cock at dawn, rising to its own song.

226
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,000
I also know that

227
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:18,060
you filmed all your scenes in the first take.

228
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,420
Don't be so modest.

229
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,330
you're the best, that's why you're here.

230
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,800
How long do you think it would take?

231
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,020
A few days.

232
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,360
I haven't translated from Russian since 1994.

233
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,740
What is it exactly?

234
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,000
Some take-over contract?

235
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:39,360
We're sending some goods to Moscow for redistribution.

236
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:54,410
- Want one? - Yes.

237
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,200
- No thanks. - You said you would.

238
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,330
Oh, sorry. I'm a bit...

239
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,180
I miss female company.

240
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,380
A least you can always arrest a fine looking lady.

241
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:21,160
Yes, but I doubt I'll ever have the real thing.

242
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,010
A relationship, marriage.

243
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,320
Like two of you.

244
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,600
You stopped hoping too soon.

245
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,180
Women here like men in uniform.

246
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,100
Especially if they're not wearing it.

247
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,010
Sorry, gotta go to the bathroom.

248
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,010
You know what they say about rye.

249
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,870
It's high time you started taking care of yourself.

250
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,200
With great talent comes a great desire for self-fuckability.

251
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,020
- When exactly, do we start? - In three days.

252
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,980
I'm not comfortable with not knowing a thing.

253
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,540
Miloš, get a grip. You're a porn actor

254
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,700
who wants to know what a porno film is about?

255
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,020
It's a bit absurd.

256
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,000
You're not supposed to know, but only to relax.

257
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:02,090
That's too much money to leave anything to accident.

258
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,870
Nothing is left to accident.

259
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:09,100
Miloš. This is a serious organization.

260
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,140
My clients know exactly what they want,

261
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,000
and I know what I'm doing.

262
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,080
Don't worry, everything is already prepared,

263
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,450
you just have to appear, be what you are,

264
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
relax

265
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,610
nd react as Miloš would.

266
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,640
Pornography should not be an illusion,

267
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,010
but a live transmission of sex.

268
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,850
- Dad. - Yes, son.

269
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,010
Remember the little wheels?

270
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,880
I do.

271
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,860
Do you know how to make them spin?

272
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,080
I do. But you must do it yourself.

273
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,010
We all do it alone.

274
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,360
Tell me how.

275
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:02,010
When you feel them, try to follow them.

276
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,540
with your hand

277
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,140
It's a family traveling

278
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:14,040
and you just close your eyes and follow them.

279
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,820
Wait, the wheels are spinning better at night.

280
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,380
Put it in your ear.

281
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,050
Enter the building, relaxed.

282
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,020
"Home for Abandoned and Orphaned Children"

283
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,460
Walk slowly ahead.

284
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,020
Be natural.

285
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,360
I wish I impaled myself on a fence rather than giving birth to you!

286
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:42,020
Haven't I told you not to let the villains take you away?

287
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,810
Get lost, you misbegotten wretch!

288
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,010
What are you staring at?

289
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,370
Bravo.

290
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,620
What was it like?

291
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,850
Fine.

292
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,760
We were filming at a home for orphaned children.

293
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,700
Where?

294
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,460
Drag yourself over here!

295
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,330
Look at yourself. You can't raise a dick,

296
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,340
how will you raise a child?

297
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,730
The child is mine.

298
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:34,010
Raiko only made it. I gave birth to it.

299
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,890
Come, you bitch!

300
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,780
Let me go, villains!

301
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,890
Give me back my child, you bastards!

302
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,760
- Honey?  - Hi.

303
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,040
- What are you doing? - I picked up Petar from classes.

304
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,060
I'm taking him to a costume party. Are you coming?

305
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,340
No, I'm tired. I must get some sleep.

306
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,690
- Everything all right? - Sure. You two enjoy yourselves.

307
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:36,000
I'll talk to you later, we must park now. Bye.

308
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:41,020
- The cake is coming. - Never seen such a cake in my life.

309
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,000
Aren't you in action?

310
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,210
Marko, you must do me a favor.

311
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,020
I'm all dick.

312
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,800
I need a detailed background check on my director,

313
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:02,100
producer, pimp, goddam businessman, Vukmir.

314
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,400
I don't know his last name. Check his whole crew.

315
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:12,450
Little bro has changed his views on checking his friends?

316
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,040
Look, it's important and urgent.

317
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,810
Understood. Everything OK with you?

318
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,010
Yes, so far. How about you?

319
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,800
Working on it.

320
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,100
Light the candles.

321
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:55,240
Happy birthday, dear Petar...

322
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,530
Baby, the time is flying and your 'animal' is snoozing again.

323
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,040
Come on, blow harder. Blow harder.

324
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,330
- Blow harder. - Bravo!

325
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:17,240
Now we're gonna open the present from uncle.

326
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,780
This is the present from your uncle.

327
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,980
How do you open this?

328
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:37,060
Happy birthday, my sweet son.

329
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:33,010
What do you think, how does he manage to be hard for so long?

330
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,800
It's not a dick, it's a police baton.

331
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,610
If you don't know, I can't help you.

332
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:49,300
Those bitches are leaking all over, and he's servicing all three of them.

333
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,170
How come he's not tired?

334
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,010
Why isn't he fucking limp, like all the normal people?

335
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,410
You're at it again!

336
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,800
That's hardly gonna shape it like we all want.

337
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,250
What was so urgent?

338
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,200
You tell me, what are we shooting?

339
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,570
Are those cameramen real cops?

340
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,140
Are they protection? From what?

341
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,720
Cut the crap!

342
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,810
You're drunk, nearly impotent and turning dumb.

343
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,120
I may be dumb, but not naive.

344
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,140
Vukmir knows what he's doing. I trust him more than myself.

345
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,100
They're the greatest pros you've ever worked with.

346
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,730
What've you done previously with those pros of yours?

347
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:51,960
Don't take it all out on me because I fuck animals for art's sake,

348
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:55,760
while you can't take a bit of uncertainty for some big bucks.

349
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:00,080
Does it mean I'll have to suck a donkey's dick for money?

350
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,170
It's not so bad, trust me.

351
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,170
Better than the crap you've been in lately.

352
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,530
- You know I miss that. - What?

353
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,840
The certainty of that crap.

354
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,380
At least I knew what I was filming.

355
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,080
Alright, do you miss this?

356
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,330
You're losing it.

357
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,680
Lucky for you Vukmir hasn't noticed yet.

358
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,960
You're resting from healthy life.

359
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,760
How was the costume party?

360
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:10,440
- What's that? - It's a balloon.

361
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,980
Your Raiko was a war hero.

362
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:46,300
If only he knew about his wife's whoring!

363
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:51,700
He would've killed both you and that poor child of yours.

364
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,010
What the hell is all this, people?

365
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,360
Hello, I can't work like this!

366
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,760
Hit the whore. Hit the whore!

367
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:29,210
Hit her.

368
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,570
Bravo, bravo!

369
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,780
Magnificent!

370
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:27,940
Miloš?

371
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:37,780
Miloš, what's wrong?

372
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,690
I'm not doing this. I'm not beating women

373
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,280
in front of kids or cameras.

374
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,130
Miloš, Jeca is our kid.

375
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:45,880
I'd never dream of hurting her.

376
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,340
Her mother fucked everything, from stones to barbed wire.

377
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,040
You're like a Sunday picnic for her.

378
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,000
I'm not only an artist but also a professional.

379
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,820
I'd never do a thing against one's will.

380
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:59,330
You're going against mine. I won't stand any kind of torture.

381
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,330
Yeah, you seem to know a lot about torture.

382
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,930
Did you enjoy it less than that midget woman

383
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:08,960
who you locked up in an oven in Stuttgart and pierced a hole in it

384
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,120
so she could suck you off for hours?

385
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:19,860
At least your dick enjoyed it,

386
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:26,640
and he never lies.

387
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:33,380
Vukmir Vukmir. His name is also his surname.

388
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:39,300
Worked as a psychologist in orphanages until 1992.

389
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:45,450
Then he moved to the Children's Program of the State TV.

390
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:47,680
It's getting better and better!

391
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:51,420
A lifelong fascination with the world of film.

392
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,970
Now, it follows with a mess

393
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:58,340
I had to clarify with data from the State Security

394
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:05,000
Allegedly, he worked for them, too.

395
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,700
Sent abroad on a mission, his trace was lost in Japan.

396
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:16,700
If he's done any movies, no one's seen them.

397
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:20,000
That's about it.

398
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,320
I don't know what bothers you.

399
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:29,570
According to this you've never worked with a more educated man.

400
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,850
Who are you gonna trust if not a child psychologist who is working for the Security?

401
00:50:43,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Hit it, dad, tear it, dad, uncle Vukmir is shooting.

402
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,020
Want something to eat?

403
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:45,200
No, I've had my daily dose of rye.

404
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,760
You don't have to go, you can do it over the phone.

405
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,840
No, I must show up. It wouldn't be fair.

406
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,320
Today we're shooting at home again.

407
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:08,500
Without me. As today, I'm retiring.

408
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,440
Is there any way for me to convince you otherwise?

409
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:17,770
No.

410
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,050
The kids bother me. I can't do such stuff in the kindergarten.

411
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,590
I fully understand you.

412
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:34,000
But, in that case between you and the kids, I must choose kids.

413
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,410
They're my specialty, my whole life.

414
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:41,870
It's my fault. I thought you'd be better if you didn't know...

415
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:46,330
If I had known from the start, I'd only have declined sooner.

416
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,990
What did you say, kindergarten?

417
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,860
That's a good term.

418
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:02,560
This whole fucking country is one big shitty kindergarten.

419
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,310
A bunch of kids discarded by their parents.

420
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,840
Do you know what it feels like?

421
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,850
Your whole life you're compelled to prove

422
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,640
that you're able to take care of yourself.

423
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,410
To prove that you can shit, eat, fuck

424
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:23,000
drink, bleed, earn money...

425
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,490
do whatever it takes to survive. Until you die!

426
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:32,000
Would you believe me if I told you that

427
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,800
me and this wonderful family, that you're so anxious to leave

428
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:42,000
are the only warrant of this nation's survival?

429
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,660
We are the backbone of this country's economy.

430
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:53,340
Only we can prove that this nation is alive

431
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:58,730
and useful for anything.

432
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:03,600
I can see that you're insane, I need no proof for that.

433
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,680
Just tell me, how does it all connect to pornography?

434
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:17,020
No, Miloš, no, no!

435
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:22,320
Not pornography. Not pornography, but life itself!

436
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,400
The life of a victim.

437
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:30,750
Love, art, blood...

438
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,780
Flesh and soul of a victim.

439
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:39,470
Transmitted live to the world who has lost all that

440
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:43,080
and now is paying to watch that

441
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,350
from the comfort of an armchair.

442
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:49,720
I have no doubt that it sells well

443
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,320
based on the sum you offered me.

444
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:56,510
Victim sells, Miloš.

445
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:03,000
Victim is the priciest sell in this world.

446
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,010
The victim feels the most and suffers the best.

447
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,330
We are victim, Miloš.

448
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:14,920
You, me, this whole nation is a victim.

449
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,010
We're just too retarded.

450
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:20,510
And I won't be a victim because of that.

451
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,850
But Miloš...

452
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,130
you're the only one in this film who is not a victim!

453
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,040
Is that so?

454
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:37,500
Allow me, as your shepherd

455
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,380
to show you the power of a real victim.

456
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:06,990
Can it be that you don't get it?

457
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,680
This is a new genre, Miloš! A new genre!

458
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:15,520
Newborn porn!

459
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,120
Newborn!

460
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:30,010
Newborn porn! Newborn!

461
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,890
...so that tomorrow, on 18th of May...

462
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:42,410
...you'll witness a new Serbian jet-set extravagance...

463
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:40,540
...so that tomorrow, on 18th of May...

464
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,980
Maria

465
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,360
Mobile user is not available at the moment...

466
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,920
Mobile user is not available at the moment...

467
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,610
If you only knew how easily cattle aphrodisiac is diluted in whiskey.

468
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:26,060
Actually, rye doesn't kill sexual desire at all, right?

469
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,600
Viagra for bulls! A special recipe concocted by our sexy doctor

470
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:39,130
who is so fond of speed that she puts it into coffee, too.

471
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,320
Can he follow my words?

472
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:46,570
Now, that's our stud!

473
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:48,350
Look at him, look at him!

474
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:51,000
Bravo, bravo!

475
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,150
She's a dirty junky cunt!

476
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:44,190
She destroyed her child, daughter of a war hero!

477
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:48,990
Sweet little Jeca watched her mother fuck the junky bums.

478
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:52,510
She is scum. Hit the whore! Hit the bitch!

479
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:58,590
Yeah, you bitch!

480
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,570
Yes, that's one of the bitch-mothers who conceive babies in lust

481
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:06,650
and than throw them into a river.

482
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:10,620
The lustful brood of wenches with endless gashes in them.

483
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:22,560
Imagine she were your son's mother.

484
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:26,460
Imagine her turning Petar into a dog-fucker's bitch!

485
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,330
Imagine that, Miloš!

486
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,240
Strike her, hit her!

487
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,340
That's it! Bravo!

488
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:59,000
The unique magic of rigor mortis!

489
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,320
Mobile user is not available at the moment...

490
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:40,010
That's right, make it right.

491
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:42,990
Fucking cell!

492
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:47,520
What?

493
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,980
Never mind, he'll come to me. Don't worry, he will.

494
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:04,010
Fucking hell. Ok, run now.

495
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:29,470
This one is on me.

496
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:08,780
Now you ruined it all. You've destroyed the project.

497
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:10,010
I did what? How?

498
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:14,000
You could've drugged any of your apes to fuck like insane.

499
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,990
You had Miloš. Now you don't.

500
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:19,470
Now he's a headless dick.

501
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:22,170
If only you sliced, say, his son's ear

502
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,450
he'd be his old self again!

503
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:28,970
He'd fuck God in the ass at your command!

504
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:34,300
Instead, you take a genius and fill him with a fuck-dope.

505
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,040
You're cheap, just like everyone else.

506
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,310
Fear is bad. It's a downer.

507
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:41,840
He needs to rise high. To feel the ecstasy of a free fuck.

508
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,620
To feel the ecstasy of a free fuck.

509
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:48,280
When he feels it, he'll forget all

510
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,780
including his wife, son, mother...

511
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:53,760
What do you know?

512
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:56,490
What do you know about free fuck?

513
01:12:56,490 --> 01:12:58,670
What do you know of ecstasy?

514
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:03,960
This is no art. You're no longer an artist!

515
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,440
I'm not working for you anymore. Nor is Miloš.

516
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,400
I'm taking him home.

517
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,320
Get away from me!

518
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:55,000
God itself brought you, son. God sent you to deliver us...

519
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:57,800
God itself brought you, son.

520
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:02,590
God sent you to deliver us...from that whore,

521
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:04,940
may she rest in peace,

522
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,830
She was a shame to our house.

523
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:18,320
Raiko was a great warrior, but had a poor taste in women.

524
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:23,680
Since he was killed, this house rots with no male to govern it.

525
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:27,850
That's why

526
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,730
God sent you

527
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:32,730
as our

528
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,050
savior

529
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:37,880
from all worry.

530
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:42,840
There's not only house,

531
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:47,920
but a daughter to take care of, too.

532
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:52,250
Our poor Jeca became an orphan.

533
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,580
My Alice in Wonderland.

534
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:03,720
Raiko was killed just when he was supposed to

535
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:07,020
prove to Jeca that he's not only a father,

536
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:08,990
but a man as well.

537
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:11,370
You came instead of him.

538
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:16,760
You'll have the honor of giving her a virgin's communion.

539
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:20,990
To make her a woman.

540
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:27,340
Like my late father did with me.

541
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:41,290
Come on, come on...

542
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:47,330
Now!

543
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:02,280
I'm gonna cut it off, you motherfuckers!

544
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,380
No, Miloš, no...

545
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,370
Our film jumped through the window!

546
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:20,620
What are you waiting for? After him!

547
01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:59,360
- Marko, it's me. Come for me. - Miloš, what's wrong?

548
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:04,830
- Where are you? - I'm on Celopecka street, no 7.

549
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,430
Come and get me.

550
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:07,450
Miloš! Hang on...

551
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:46,030
Hey, baby, where you headin' for?

552
01:21:46,330 --> 01:21:51,080
Out naked, but won't take a dick?

553
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:54,730
Be polite, the girl is underage.

554
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,640
So what if I am underage?

555
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,660
Look at this jerk!

556
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:33,370
Raša, don't.

557
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:46,540
Rare kind of Monks put seven adult he-goats

558
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:48,400
into a shed during summer.

559
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:51,560
They leave them for a month

560
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:56,000
until their balls are like melons.

561
01:22:56,460 --> 01:23:00,400
When they get too hot, they start fucking one another.

562
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:04,700
The monks take the dried bloody cum off their balls

563
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,440
and mix it with milk.

564
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:11,120
It makes the finest bread spread there is.

565
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:19,280
You're a he-goat, Miloš. I'm your monk.

566
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:21,790
Don't worry, my child.

567
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,120
My he-goat.

568
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:38,040
I'll provide a fitting end for you.

569
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:53,680
Welcome to a warm family home.

570
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:53,310
A real, happy Serbian family.

571
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:57,020
Life...

572
01:29:59,070 --> 01:30:00,450
Art.

573
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:33,330
That's it, Miloš. That's cinema.

574
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:51,370
That's film!

575
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,120
Get away from me!

576
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:57,320
In a winter night

577
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:02,680
way up the hill.

578
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:08,880
A creek was frozen

579
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:13,950
nd covered by the snow.

580
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:35,660
Come on.

581
01:39:40,990 --> 01:39:42,300
Start with the little one.
