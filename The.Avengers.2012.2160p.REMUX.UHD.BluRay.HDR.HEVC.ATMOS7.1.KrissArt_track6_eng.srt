1
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:16,653
This is not how I wanted this evening
to go.

2
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,488
I know how you wanted this evening
to go.

3
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:19,698
Believe me

4
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:20,824
this is better.

5
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,702
Who are you working for?

6
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,662
Lermentov, yes?

7
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,291
Does he think

8
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,168
we have to go through him

9
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,170
to move our cargo?

10
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:39,217
I thought General Solohob
is in charge of the export business.

11
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,595
Solohob

12
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,847
a bagman, a front.

13
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:50,479
Your outdated information betrays you.

14
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,650
The famous Black Widow

15
00:12:56,401 --> 00:13:00,656
and she turns out to be
simply another pretty face.

16
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:04,701
You really think I'm pretty?

17
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,665
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

18
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:13,543
to move the tanks.

19
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,130
Tell him he is out.

20
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:19,174
Well...

21
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,231
It's for her.

22
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,027
You listen carefully

23
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:40,524
Who are you?

24
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,192
Get out!

25
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,820
There is sickness here!

26
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:48,907
My father's not waking up!

27
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,617
He has a fever and he's moaning

28
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,868
but his eyes won't open.

29
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:52,953
Slow down.

30
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,497
My father...

31
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,167
Like them?
