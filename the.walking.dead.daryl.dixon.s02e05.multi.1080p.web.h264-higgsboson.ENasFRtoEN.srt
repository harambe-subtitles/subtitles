1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,080
I'm going to show you how to use it.

2
00:00:39,150 --> 00:01:10,480
How's it going, Bastien?

3
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,120
It's not easy.

4
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,980
We're all trying to figure out what happened at the nest.

5
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,740
Balozard was a good guy.

6
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,520
He brought along good people like Emile.

7
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,740
But we stayed the same.

8
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,540
We move forward as best we can.

9
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,840
What about Laurent?

10
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,580
Laurent has always been a symbol of what the future can offer.

11
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,120
For me, he's still there.

12
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,180
Here, with us, he's safe.

13
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,320
We were expecting someone?

14
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,200
No, no, there's no one.

15
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,300
Everyone in position.

16
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,100
Open the door.

17
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,080
You?

18
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,740
How did you get here?

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,540
Please, let me explain.

20
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,980
What do you mean you're not here to kill Daryl or the world?

21
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,400
He saved my life.

22
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,940
All of us.

23
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,160
Daryl, Isabelle, Sylvie.

24
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,620
On a road over there.

25
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,800
They were going to kill us, but he stopped them.

26
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,880
He let us go.

27
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,280
I have information on Juni.

28
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
And Yoracho.

29
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,160
We know I was there.

30
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,340
Your boss was caught by Jeunet.

31
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,840
They locked him up.

32
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,760
They did?

33
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,600
Good.

34
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,880
That's what he deserves.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,380
What about Isa?

36
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,660
And Daryl?

37
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,940
Did they make it out alive?

38
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,720
I don't know.

39
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,120
There was a woman.

40
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,060
What woman?

41
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,060
An American. She was looking for him.

42
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,900
We were separated after the fights.

43
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,600
Is her name Carole?

44
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,400
You're right.

45
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,280
Bringing the kid back, that wasn't part of the plan.

46
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
Is he going to be alright with that?

47
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,680
Sure, once I explain things to him.

48
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,470
You know it's probably better if I talk to Ash alone.

49
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,770
He's not going to be that comfortable with you at first.

50
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,290
He knows you were looking for me though, right?

51
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,410
It's just that he's lived alone all this time.

52
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,810
It's the first time out in the world.

53
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,070
He's nervous.

54
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,210
I don't want him to overreact.

55
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,510
Look around. This place ain't safe.

56
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,030
Not really. You know I got it.

57
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,690
You don't need to take any dumb risks.

58
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,570
How do you think I found you?

59
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,269
No, I'm coming.

60
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,410
Okay, look. Look.

61
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,820
When I said to him,

62
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,100
to persuade him to do this whole thing,

63
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,220
I embellished some facts a little.

64
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,280
So you lied?

65
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,300
You could say.

66
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,840
You going to tell him I'm your brother or something?

67
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,520
No, nothing like that.

68
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,350
Nah, I'm coming.

69
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,590
I'm going to do all the talking.

70
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,390
Please let me get in front.

71
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:02,630
Jesus.

72
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,890
Looks like Ash has been busy.

73
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:07,970
Ash?

74
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,210
It's Carol.

75
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,670
Wait, wait.

76
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,380
Ash!

77
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,860
Are you here?

78
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,720
Ash!

79
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:31,770
Hi.

80
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:33,950
Over here.

81
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,190
Is that guy still alive?

82
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,350
Where's Ash?

83
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,050
The man that was here, where is he?

84
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,450
The man? What happened to the man?

85
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,190
He never came back.

86
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,070
What were you doing here?

87
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,590
We came to find the plane.

88
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,230
It was us, really.

89
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,750
Not you.

90
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,100
What are you saying?

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,120
Please.

92
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,700
Please.

93
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:17,920
Please.

94
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:19,840
You'll kill me.

95
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,810
You'll kill me, please.

96
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,810
I got this.

97
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:32,700
I got this.

98
00:07:32,700 --> 00:08:10,590
You think these folks are going to be able to help us find Ash?

99
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,730
Yeah, I hope so.

100
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,210
He's not like us.

101
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,290
He's nice, he's gentle.

102
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,490
Do you have a crush on him?

103
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,170
No, I like him though.

104
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,390
He's a really good person, not easy to find these days.

105
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,710
Who's that lie you told him? What was that about?

106
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,110
I told him I was looking for my daughter.

107
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,070
Sophia?

108
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,809
I don't even know where it came from.

109
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:42,549
I was just searching for a reason, thinking about you.

110
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,640
Everything we've been through, all the loss, and I just...

111
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,350
Maybe I do know where it came from.

112
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:49,950
Hello.

113
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,890
Hi, Nadine.

114
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,830
Cyril.

115
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,410
You made it.

116
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,170
Yeah.

117
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,850
What made you come here?

118
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,760
I didn't know where to go.

119
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,200
You were with the ladies.

120
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,600
Locking you up in the mother's house made me think.

121
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,400
Thinking about my brother, Michel.

122
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,600
My parents.

123
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,720
The men in the south.

124
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,880
All dead.

125
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,780
All those I wanted to protect, all those I loved, they're gone.

126
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,700
And why?

127
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,520
Because of me.

128
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,060
There he is.

129
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,760
You're back.

130
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,860
You okay?

131
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:58,700
Yeah.

132
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
And Carol, from the Commonwealth, right?

133
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:02,940
That's right.

134
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,760
Bienvenue, mon ami.

135
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,420
I prayed for you.

136
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,500
And Judith, and RJ, and Ezekiel.

137
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,380
I've heard a lot about you.

138
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,580
Where's Iza?

139
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,660
Hey, I'll talk to you for a second.

140
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,840
We heard Jenna was dead.

141
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,600
But we were unsure it was true.

142
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,000
It's true.

143
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,660
Maybe now, it will be safer here.

144
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,340
I hope so.

145
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,660
For all of you.

146
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,340
How about this friend you're looking for?

147
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,440
What do you know?

148
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,840
He must be in trouble.

149
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,960
She's with my mother now.

150
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:09,830
Yeah.

151
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,850
She died protecting her.

152
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,870
That's what she wanted.

153
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,010
Like Sylvie.

154
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,390
And the sisters.

155
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,750
That's right.

156
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,570
It's a terrible thing to think of.

157
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,150
A world without them in it.

158
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,400
Yeah.

159
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,220
Yeah, it is.

160
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,980
She loved you.

161
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:57,870
She told me.

162
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,720
You know, Isabelle and I were talking

163
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,700
about the three of us going back to America.

164
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,840
We could still do that.

165
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,380
Together.

166
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,760
Carol has a friend who has a plane.

167
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,740
We just gotta find him and then we'll do that.

168
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,000
Alright?

169
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,580
Do you think that someday,

170
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,620
this will all be over?

171
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,520
And we'll be able to do normal things?

172
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,840
We'll be able to go to school with other kids?

173
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,020
See a movie?

174
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,100
Ride a bike?

175
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,760
Then we have something like that back home.

176
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,440
Hell, I'll teach you how to ride a bike.

177
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,800
I don't think so.

178
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,970
I should stay here.

179
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,010
And you should go back where you belong.

180
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,820
That's what you always wanted.

181
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,480
I was wrong.

182
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,600
It's not what I want.

183
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,720
Hell, it's not what you want either.

184
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,940
It's different now.

185
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:45,660
Why?

186
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,120
Why is it different?

187
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,480
Because I feel at peace here.

188
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,910
Don't be sad.

189
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,110
I'm happy here.

190
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,950
And you'll be happy too when you go back home.

191
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,260
You sure?

192
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,660
Good night.

193
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,900
Honey, can you sit here?

194
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,180
Yes, Jessica?

195
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,520
Where are we going?

196
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,340
To look for Ash.

197
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:00,820
Why?

198
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,500
You wanna talk about it?

199
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,860
No.

200
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,760
You mind if I do?

201
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,140
I know you really wanted him to come.

202
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,420
And I know he's not.

203
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,700
And that sucks.

204
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,020
And I'm really sorry.

205
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,540
I let him down.

206
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,660
Can't really blame him.

207
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,020
So what, he's getting back at you?

208
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,640
I probably deserve it.

209
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,440
I mean, I'm here, she's not.

210
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,440
Right?

211
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,280
And now you're replaying every decision.

212
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,140
Thinking of everything you could have done differently.

213
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,460
It's a pretty long list.

214
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,400
Yeah, me both.

215
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,080
The past has just become

216
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,420
one big giant hole of what ifs.

217
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,580
Why us?

218
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,080
You and me.

219
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,600
Why do we get to go so far?

220
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,589
Luck?

221
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,030
Bad luck, maybe.

222
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,089
I just kinda wanted to tell the difference.

223
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,170
Carole.

224
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,790
Hey.

225
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,410
It won't be easy tracking down your friend.

226
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,970
The stranger out there alone for that long.

227
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,810
What are the chances you'll find him alive?

228
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,890
I found him alive.

229
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,090
What are the chances of that?

230
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,110
Come on, Wayne. You know where to look.

231
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,310
There's still only one place to go for information.

232
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,370
Hell yeah, I'm not too popular there.

233
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,270
What place is that?

234
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,370
Welcome to the Demi Mall.

235
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,970
Bonjour, mon beau.

236
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,150
Bienvenue.

237
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:02,570
Bonjour.

238
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,070
Tu veux que je te fasse kiffer?

239
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,390
No, I'm good.

240
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,170
Thank you.

241
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:10,850
Et toi?

242
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,310
Mm-hmm.

243
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,300
Beso.

244
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:19,880
Yeah.

245
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,050
What?

246
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,480
Nice man.

247
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,940
I guess not anymore.

248
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,480
What's that right there?

249
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,940
Daryl Jackson.

250
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,500
I heard you were a dad.

251
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,100
Not yet.

252
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,840
Make yourself at home.

253
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,500
All right.

254
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,520
Hey.

255
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,550
I love what you've done with the place.

256
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,570
Listen up the rules.

257
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,370
Rules are so British and people want to be free, especially French people.

258
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,830
Queen never understood that.

259
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,770
I mean, some of his men did.

260
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,750
Others needed a little convincing.

261
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,970
Hey, good job.

262
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,310
You're very popular with the guerrilla.

263
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,890
When the queen dies, the bees scatter with the honey.

264
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,250
And who are you exactly?

265
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,770
She's a friend of mine.

266
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,630
Oh, another friend.

267
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,270
What happened to the last one, the nun?

268
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,350
She died.

269
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:25,360
And the boy?

270
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,480
Somewhere safe.

271
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,620
No one can find him or hurt him.

272
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,080
I did what I had to.

273
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,760
It was Queen.

274
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,160
I'm sorry for Aeneas.

275
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,360
What do you call it?

276
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,660
Collateral damage.

277
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,140
Well, you can make it up to us.

278
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,760
We're looking for someone.

279
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,340
Another American?

280
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,940
Oh, people are everywhere.

281
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,680
How exactly did you come to France?

282
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,720
Does it matter?

283
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,100
Not to me.

284
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:06,700
But you show up around the same time an airplane landed west of the city.

285
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,020
Be careful.

286
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,320
Some people will do anything for a way out.

287
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,820
Yeah, we'll keep that in mind.

288
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,880
In fact, I hired a few men to track it down.

289
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,640
They never came back.

290
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,760
What about our friend?

291
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,120
I'll put out a word.

292
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,360
What is it?

293
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,910
This red one, where did it come from?

294
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:49,970
Julia?

295
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,830
Is that two of them?

296
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,310
Two warriors brought them here four or five days ago.

297
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,690
From the mother's house.

298
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:00,890
Mother's house?

299
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:03,990
That's what it used to be.

300
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,590
Nothing left.

301
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,290
From what I hear.

302
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,450
We'll need a car.

303
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,310
And weapons.

304
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,580
Well...

305
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,860
First of all...

306
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,020
What does it taste like?

307
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,560
Sweet.

308
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,680
Well, I think.

309
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,520
It's been so long, I don't even remember.

310
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,080
Why did you want to kill Daryl?

311
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,190
Because he killed my brother.

312
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,970
I was angry.

313
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,890
Because you love your brother too much?

314
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,950
Anger is...

315
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,350
It's a disease.

316
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,330
It can make you do terrible things.

317
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,090
Was your brother a bad person?

318
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:33,350
No.

319
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,590
He was afraid.

320
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,530
Fear can also make us do terrible things.

321
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,910
I should have protected him from all that.

322
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,200
You know...

323
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,340
What you told me on the road...

324
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,460
I believed you.

325
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,080
God loves us all.

326
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,220
And for the first time, you see, I had...

327
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,940
I felt like he was looking at me.

328
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,120
To see what I was going to do.

329
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,440
What decision I was going to make.

330
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,500
And you did what you had to.

331
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,280
But I hurt you a lot.

332
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,380
I'm sorry.

333
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,230
I've already forgiven you.

334
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,030
And I hope that one day,

335
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,110
you'll forgive him too.

336
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:59,270
Put your guns down.

337
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,690
Put your guns down.

338
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,660
We don't want any harm.

339
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,940
Don't worry.

340
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,620
No guards.

341
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,960
Yeah, I noticed.

342
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,160
You okay?

343
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,380
Just thrilled to be back.

344
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,060
Yeah.

345
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,920
Yeah, good times.

346
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,610
Don't be alarmed by the Gurriers.

347
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,950
They're brothers and sisters,

348
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,210
united in our cause.

349
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,750
But the message will be lost

350
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,390
without the boy.

351
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,270
Laurent is the chosen one.

352
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,030
He needs to be protected.

353
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,990
We're hoping he's here.

354
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,230
We sent Laurent to you,

355
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,550
at the nest.

356
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,070
He was taken from us,

357
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,670
lured away by the Americans.

358
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,190
Then, must I find him?

359
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:41,910
Make preparations.

360
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,710
We go out at once.

361
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,630
We split into groups to cover more of the city.

362
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,750
Come on, let's go.

363
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,110
Wait!

364
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,810
Go on.

365
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,030
On the table.

366
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,150
Over there.

367
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,280
Find him.

368
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,780
Matisse, come with me. You go there.

369
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,940
You two, go there. You too.

370
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,570
I'll check in here.

371
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:57,860
Go.

372
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,160
I'm looking for some kind of trouble.

373
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,780
If I don't make it back,

374
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,070
I want him to know I tried.

375
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,490
Hell, I'm still trying.

376
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,780
Hey, I found something.

377
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,760
Damn?

378
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:00,570
No.

379
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:06,170
No.

380
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:12,390
No, it's not here.

381
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,050
Maybe it was never here.

382
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,510
Maybe we're in the wrong place.

383
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:20,870
Come on, look at that.

384
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,310
There's got to be something alive in there.

385
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:29,290
Come on.

386
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,150
Come on.

387
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,050
Drop your weapon!

388
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,850
Brother Fallou!

389
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,050
I'm not your brother.

390
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,990
You're a disappointing brother,

391
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,270
seduced by the traitor Dixon.

392
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,440
You have your word, you have it.

393
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,780
He has his own, he applies it.

394
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,780
Dixon is faithful only to himself.

395
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,900
He wants to go home.

396
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,420
He wants to go back to his world.

397
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,160
If he takes the boy, what becomes of ours?

398
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,460
Darid wants to save Laurent.

399
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,100
You want to make him a martyr.

400
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,360
Look.

401
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,960
Look at how we have to hide from the hungry ones.

402
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,540
On the rooftops, in the cellars.

403
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,280
Our children, all they've known is fear.

404
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,500
You ready?

405
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,860
And what of their children?

406
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,620
The living coward?

407
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,940
The numbers dwindling, the dead flourishing.

408
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,720
The natural order of things twisted and perverted beyond comprehension.

409
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,260
Some people believe the world has ended.

410
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,360
That God is also dead.

411
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,040
That is why we must find him!

412
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,360
The world must see that God is still here,

413
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,980
and the boy is proof!

414
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,580
That's what faith is?

415
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,040
If you need proof,

416
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,560
you've already lost it.

417
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,060
You made it.

418
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,560
You're going to be okay.

419
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,560
You look okay.

420
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,800
What is that?

421
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,260
Don't worry, we're going to get you out of here.

422
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,980
I'm going to get you out.

423
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:44,170
Okay.

424
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,620
It's probably just a concussion.

425
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:06,860
Dehydrated.

426
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,760
I don't think anything's broken.

427
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,300
How many rounds you got left?

428
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,620
One.

429
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,920
We're going to get back to the car.

430
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,230
Got any ideas?

431
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,190
Not any good ones.

432
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:33,930
What about battery?

433
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,170
You got any battery left?

434
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,130
No, but this thing's not moving.

435
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,990
We just need to crack a window.

436
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:47,460
No!

437
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,390
Where's Sofia?

438
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,740
Let's just get you out of here.

439
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,480
Finish this water, I'll get you some more, okay?

440
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,150
I don't know about this thing.

441
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,090
You really think this is going to get us home?

442
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,490
You got us here.

443
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,990
How much fuel we need?

444
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:35,930
Added to what we have,

445
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,770
50 gallons should get us all the way back home.

446
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:39,710
Alright.

447
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,780
Can I talk to you for a second?

448
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,240
You know you should tell him the truth.

449
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,380
I just want him to get healthy before I break his heart.

450
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,920
Why her though?

451
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,020
Why don't you just lie about something else?

452
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,480
I had to be convincing.

453
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,080
I made up something that I wished was true.

454
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,320
And he lost his son.

455
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:21,920
Got it.

456
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,960
Why don't you get him ready to fly?

457
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,700
I'll go find some fuel.

458
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,100
Alright?

459
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,340
Yeah?

460
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:17,340
Can I talk to you for a minute?

461
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,340
Back so soon?

462
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:21,940
Come on.

463
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,320
I've got a present for you.

464
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:27,840
Hi.

465
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,320
You alright?

466
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,340
Yeah.

467
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,880
What are you doing here?

468
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,320
We came here looking for you.

469
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,960
Razan came to the camp.

470
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,080
And now Jeanine's dead.

471
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,260
He has some other people behind him.

472
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,600
So I brought him here.

473
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,620
Thank you.

474
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,460
How are you?

475
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,380
What about everyone else?

476
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,440
They alright?

477
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,240
Yeah.

478
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,900
Razan is only interested in one thing.

479
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,570
I need your help.

480
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,570
You can't.

481
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,610
People are going to talk.

482
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,600
I can get you the fuel you need.

483
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,620
Thanks, I appreciate it.

484
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,140
I'm not doing it for you.

485
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,300
Max, load him up with as much ethanol as he can carry.

486
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,180
Not sure we have enough to just give it away.

487
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,560
I'm sorry.

488
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,920
It sounded like you were trying to express an opinion.

489
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Didn't think so.

490
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:47,540
Faster.

491
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:48,500
Deal.

492
00:39:48,500 --> 00:40:00,220
So you'll take the boy with you, huh?

493
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,700
What's the plan?

494
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,380
There'll be enough with your neighbor for a while.

495
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,560
Laurent will be safer in America.

496
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,480
At least you guys don't fall for fascists.

497
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,040
The student becomes the master.

498
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,620
I take it she's not coming.

499
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,900
She didn't make it?

500
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:44,860
No.

501
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,860
There's nothing you can do halfway across the world.

502
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,940
Do you want to talk about it?

503
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:50,440
No.

504
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,100
I'm sorry.

505
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,720
I'm so sorry.

506
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,440
For what?

507
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,680
All of it.

508
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,640
So easy for us to blame ourselves.

509
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,320
During the days I spent waiting for you, I just got to thinking.

510
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,860
How was this trip?

511
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,620
It helped me.

512
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,120
It helped you?

513
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,800
Get past the guilt.

514
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,680
I've been carrying a lot of it.

515
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,120
Coming here with you just forced me to overcome it.

516
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,520
To live again.

517
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,680
You did that for me, Carol.

518
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,920
I'm really sorry I didn't end up better for you.

519
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,690
Well, this one was great.

520
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:16,180
You should come with us.

521
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,200
I want to stay at the camp.

522
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,880
It's not safe at the camp.

523
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,800
Philippe will find a new place.

524
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,580
And I have friends there.

525
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,100
You can find friends anywhere.

526
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,980
You can find friends where we're going.

527
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:28,760
There's kids there.

528
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,240
Carol's there. I'm there.

529
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,580
I can't come with you.

530
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,020
Why?

531
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,180
I don't want to.

532
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,080
Explain it to me.

533
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:35,920
I just can't.

534
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,460
Why not?

535
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,120
Because I don't want you to die.

536
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:45,150
The sisters, Isabelle, Sylvie, they're all gone.

537
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:46,270
Because of me.

538
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:51,210
Everybody, everybody I love dies.

539
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:52,350
That's not true.

540
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,590
It has nothing to do with you.

541
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,770
Let's go, everyone.

542
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,350
You have to get out of here.

543
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:09,550
Where's Laurent?

544
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:11,690
Come on, move.

545
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,210
Come with me, quickly.

546
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:17,230
Grab his stuff.

547
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:18,810
You distract them from me, okay?

548
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:21,970
Need a little push?

549
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,090
No, thank you.

550
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:28,780
Gilbert?

551
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:33,570
Are you okay?

552
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:34,690
It's okay.

553
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,700
There you go.

554
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:43,830
Lozang, he's here.

555
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,650
You must be the Hope guy.

556
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:58,590
Where are they?

557
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,190
In the same air.

558
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,050
Is that so?

559
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,430
You believe in miracles, right?

560
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:19,740
Lozang!

561
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,080
Help me move this.

562
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,370
The truth is hope.

563
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:39,370
Let's go.

564
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,240
Follow me.

565
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:06,780
Dixon?

566
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,160
Mr. Caudron?

567
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:08,620
Yeah.

568
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:10,240
Hi.

569
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,380
Hi, which way now?

570
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,560
They're coming.

571
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,820
All right, split up.

572
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:20,660
Come on.

573
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,060
Wait.

574
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,740
They split up.

575
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:36,880
Gilbert?

576
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,280
Gilbert Fallon.

577
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:40,720
With me.

578
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,480
The others, follow me.

579
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,300
I need you to do something for me, all right?

580
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,820
Come on, get in.

581
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,060
You stay here until I come back and get you, okay?

582
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,780
What if he didn't come back?

583
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:08,800
Hey.

584
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,140
When has that ever happened?

585
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,400
You turn it off.

586
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,940
We're gonna get through this, okay?

587
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:34,430
Fallon!

588
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:38,910
What's that?

589
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,230
We stay on guard.

590
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,200
Gilbert Fallon.

591
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:49,520
Over there.

592
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,760
Come on.

593
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,180
Let's go.

594
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:20,620
This way.

595
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:56,850
I don't think I can get any cleaner than that.

596
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:00,110
You should get some more rest.

597
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:03,270
Well, a little activity would be good for me.

598
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:07,190
After being stuck in a car for two days.

599
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:08,770
I'm gonna go.

600
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,100
I really appreciate you making this trip for me.

601
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,900
I'm glad you feel like it was worth it.

602
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,890
The thing is...

603
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:30,050
I lied.

604
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,040
I didn't come here looking for Sophia.

605
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,640
I came here to look for Daryl.

606
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,900
What are you saying?

607
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,340
Sophia died 12 years ago.

608
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,340
No, you...

609
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,400
You said that...

610
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,740
No, I know what I said.

611
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,640
It's not like that.

612
00:52:59,080 --> 00:52:59,980
What's it like, then?

613
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,600
It's like she never went away.

614
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,020
It's like I never...

615
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,560
let her go because I never forgave myself.

616
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,400
I think you get that.

617
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,880
I know that we share that feeling.

618
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,860
And lately, that feeling's gotten worse.

619
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,840
And when I met you...

620
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,300
I told you what I needed to,

621
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,560
to convince you to help.

622
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,420
So, that makes it all right?

623
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,620
It's not an excuse.

624
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:27,600
It's just an explanation.

625
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,440
I really hope your therapy is going well.

626
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,820
I know how terrible this is.

627
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,280
It's not just that you lied.

628
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,440
It's the lie itself.

629
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,780
I mean, using your dead daughter

630
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,660
to manipulate me.

631
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,060
What kind of person does that?

632
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,240
A really desperate one, I'm sorry.

633
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,120
I believed in you, don't you get that?

634
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,760
I gave up everything.

635
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:52,240
I gave up my world, I gave up my home,

636
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,160
my memory of Obby.

637
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,920
But you said before...

638
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:57,080
You think the end justified the means?

639
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:57,980
No.

640
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,040
Whatever was happening between us,

641
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,380
every moment of comfort,

642
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:02,560
or bonding,

643
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,140
or whatever the fuck you want to call it,

644
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,760
it was goddamn fucking meaningless.

645
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,640
The pain was real, the grief...

646
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,180
Oh, come on!

647
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,060
It was all based in a lie.

648
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,200
Your lie to get my fucking plane!

649
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,000
Goddammit!

650
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:18,740
Don't.

651
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,000
Thank you.

652
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,560
You are always welcome in the damn amount.

653
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:38,600
Okay.

654
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:52,240
All right, you ready?

655
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,600
To go where?

656
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,100
To America.

657
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,640
I told you, I'm not going.

658
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:58,940
Look, I know what you said,

659
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,960
but I think you got it wrong.

660
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:01,600
You blame yourself.

661
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,680
I get it, that's what kids do.

662
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,480
But you gotta let go of the things that scare you.

663
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,520
Isabel wanted you to go.

664
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:09,940
I want you to go.

665
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,880
But you gotta make up your own mind.

666
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:17,970
On what it's gonna be.

667
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:23,030
Okay.

668
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:25,090
Good.

669
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:27,090
Go get your shit, let's go.

670
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:35,510
It's like the future.

671
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:38,350
Yep, sure does.

672
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:42,330
There it is.

673
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,670
You ever seen one of these before?

674
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:47,770
No, only in books.

675
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:49,690
Up in the clouds,

676
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,790
we'll be close to Isa and Sylvie.

677
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,050
And my mother.

678
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:54,810
Yeah, they can watch over us.

679
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:57,570
How did it go?

680
00:55:58,470 --> 00:55:59,530
Not so good.

681
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:04,570
You feeling any better?

682
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,340
Who is this?

683
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,420
That's Laurent.

684
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,320
This is Ash.

685
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,400
This is his plane.

686
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:18,860
Hi.

687
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,320
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

688
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,700
I've never flown in a plane before.

689
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,680
Ash is gonna be the one flying us home.

690
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,060
Yeah, well, one small hitch.

691
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,580
This plane will never get off the ground with all four of us.

692
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,880
So, Paris, we have a problem.
