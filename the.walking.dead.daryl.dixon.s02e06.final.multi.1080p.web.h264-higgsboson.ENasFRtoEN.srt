1
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,540
I'm going to teach you how to play the accordion.

2
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,560
He likes 70s rock. Neil Young, John Baez, Led Zeppelin.

3
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,240
You're not coming, are you?

4
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,960
Somebody has to stay behind.

5
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,100
It makes sense that it's me.

6
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,660
You want to talk about it?

7
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,020
Why? Why not change your mind?

8
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,080
Every time something good happens,

9
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,360
something bad comes to ruin it.

10
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,420
It's only temporary.

11
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,340
Then why does it feel like forever?

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,420
It's a long way to America. You'll be all alone.

13
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,440
I've been alone before.

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,460
A lot of times.

15
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,820
I'll make it back.

16
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,700
You can't promise that.

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,860
Hey, look at me.

18
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,420
I can't promise that.

19
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,900
I'll see you again.

20
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,220
Go ahead, play something.

21
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,890
It's just my phone.

22
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,410
What do you want?

23
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,060
You want to punish me, I get it.

24
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,260
But you won't be doing any worse than I'm already doing to myself.

25
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,180
Please don't take it out on them.

26
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:27,960
Here.

27
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,200
Thanks.

28
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,080
See those spasms?

29
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,640
That means he's dehydrated.

30
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,080
Do you know anyone who's dehydrated?

31
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,280
My father was a farmer in Algeria before we emigrated.

32
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,380
Do you know any brothers and sisters?

33
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,420
Two brothers died.

34
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,080
And a sister, Jamila. I lost track of her.

35
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,480
What about you?

36
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,540
I left Cameroon on my own.

37
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,760
When the hungry arrived, I had nothing left to lose.

38
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,800
It's hard to go on when you have nothing left to lose.

39
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,060
Let's check.

40
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,980
They can stay here with the horses.

41
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,100
Shouldn't we all stay together?

42
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,480
It's a bit dangerous in there.

43
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,120
That's exactly what I just said.

44
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,880
Interesting.

45
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,980
Watch out.

46
00:05:45,190 --> 00:06:28,660
The French health system

47
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,200
is the best in the world.

48
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,940
I'm going to check the side.

49
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:50,900
Yeah.

50
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,420
Slowly.

51
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,790
Do you see the guns?

52
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:42,590
No.

53
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,730
The plane? Where is it?

54
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,370
What does it matter?

55
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,690
The cause is dead.

56
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,510
No, the cause isn't dead.

57
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,270
Serge Assinta will make sure the prophecy comes true.

58
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,560
They left in the meantime.

59
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,280
We watched them.

60
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,880
No planes in the sky the last two days.

61
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,000
So?

62
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,500
They didn't tell us anything.

63
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,340
Speak.

64
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,280
I think you know.

65
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,500
So what?

66
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,820
Do we have to kill your friend?

67
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,520
The guys.

68
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,580
We have to warn Dixon.

69
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,020
We don't know where they are.

70
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,050
I know.

71
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,490
I don't think he likes me.

72
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,710
Who, Ash?

73
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,150
He's got a lot on his mind.

74
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,570
I don't know what you're talking about.

75
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,170
Because you lied to him.

76
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,630
Something like that.

77
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,010
And now you feel bad too.

78
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,770
People shouldn't lie.

79
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,910
No, they shouldn't.

80
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,530
But I'm glad you did.

81
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,550
If you told Asher the truth, you might not be here.

82
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,030
And neither would Daryl.

83
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,850
You have a really special way of seeing things, don't you?

84
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,850
You're going to make a lot of friends at the Commonwealth.

85
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,590
Do you think Daryl will be able to make it back by himself?

86
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,800
What kind of hose are we looking for?

87
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,600
Something long enough to run from an external tank.

88
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,880
So we don't have to stop.

89
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,580
Yeah, Greenland. I heard about that.

90
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,960
Hey, look man.

91
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,560
I don't really need any help here.

92
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,340
All right, fair enough.

93
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,300
What happened to his parents?

94
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:41,840
They were wrong.

95
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,580
He's an orphan.

96
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,770
I'm sorry about your kid.

97
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,330
Carol told me.

98
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,210
I was there when she lost Sophia.

99
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,990
I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

100
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,770
You lose a wife or a husband, you're a widower.

101
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,230
A widow.

102
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,640
If you lose a kid, there's no word for that.

103
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,700
I mean, that's too hard of a thing to name.

104
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,580
You got kids?

105
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,540
No.

106
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,020
Well, maybe it's a good thing you don't have that worry.

107
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,860
I worry about plenty.

108
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,430
You know, you came here to save a kid.

109
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,650
You still can.

110
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,910
Wait a minute.

111
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,670
Hey!

112
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,480
I guess I am kind of glad you're coming with us.

113
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,700
I used to live on the street when I first moved here.

114
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,500
Ran away, actually, from our little village to be a singer.

115
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,980
I hated my mother for not believing in me,

116
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,480
but maybe she was just trying to protect me.

117
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,340
She could only see you now.

118
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,700
I wonder if she'd be ashamed.

119
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,900
Where is she, anyway?

120
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,860
Back home, I guess.

121
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,700
In Karelia.

122
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,270
Stop her! Get out!

123
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,390
Stop the car!

124
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,250
What's going on?

125
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,210
You want to get us killed?

126
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,190
Get out.

127
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,130
Perhaps you remember me.

128
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,450
From that cesspool you operate.

129
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:21,510
Oh, yeah.

130
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,050
You came with a man.

131
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:25,810
And left alone.

132
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,910
I want the same thing he wanted.

133
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,450
I didn't help him. Why help you?

134
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,110
Ouch.

135
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,930
I know they have an airplane.

136
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:58,270
Help me find them or your friend's pretty face goes next.

137
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,460
This is why I don't make friends.

138
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,440
And I don't give without getting something good in return.

139
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,040
What about your life?

140
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,380
You could take it.

141
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,900
Or leave it.

142
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,480
What do you want?

143
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,490
To go home.

144
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,950
Back where my people are.

145
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:40,570
So.

146
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,710
I help you find the boy.

147
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,850
I get the plane.

148
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,030
And the pilot.

149
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,650
So, this way.

150
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,140
We're gonna be able to talk.

151
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,690
This tells us how high we are.

152
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,140
Pretty good with him, huh?

153
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,960
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

154
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:14,920
Yep.

155
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,180
Brought you something?

156
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,520
No way.

157
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,640
You lug this all the way here?

158
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,620
Well, he allowed one carry-on, so.

159
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:26,980
Yeah.

160
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,740
Thank you.

161
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,050
Daryl, listen.

162
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,270
Look, I know what you're gonna say.

163
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,270
You ain't staying.

164
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,290
It's the right thing.

165
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,750
For everybody.

166
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,250
It's already settled.

167
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,650
I'm gonna get you home, even if it means me staying behind.

168
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,070
Because if anything happens to you,

169
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,790
I'm not gonna be able to live with myself.

170
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:51,850
He's right.

171
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,360
Daryl has been here longer.

172
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,320
On the ground.

173
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,080
He knows how to survive.

174
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,940
And you know the plane.

175
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,020
You can help me.

176
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,520
Ash, this isn't about that.

177
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,540
It is about whatever can get that kid back to a safe place.

178
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,300
Looks like you're outnumbered.

179
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,150
Shh.

180
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,140
Easy, Falou!

181
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,200
Jacinta's still alive.

182
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,300
They're coming for Lorne.

183
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,760
You ready to fly?

184
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,980
You gotta go right now.

185
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,280
Come on, help me get this wall down.

186
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,740
Let's go right there.

187
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,359
I gotta test the engine.

188
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,410
The plane is on the other side, near the racetrack.

189
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:24,670
They won't see you coming this way.

190
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:25,970
You, you go there.

191
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:26,930
You and you, there.

192
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,740
I stay here if they're looking for Jacinta.

193
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,440
Go ahead.

194
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
It doesn't look like it used to.

195
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,740
Does it?

196
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,460
It will be beautiful again.

197
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:08,880
Someday.

198
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,520
I hope you get to go home soon.

199
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,340
So, which way?

200
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,620
Through the garage.

201
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,240
It will take you to the track.

202
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,120
Okay.

203
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,300
Go ahead, lead the way.

204
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,820
After you.

205
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:17,420
You knew.

206
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,240
Jacinta will kill you.

207
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,160
No, God is on our side.

208
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,220
God gave up on us a long time ago.

209
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,560
Do you hear that?

210
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,060
It's the plane.

211
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,420
You two go there, the others come with me.

212
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:25,890
Carburetor is a little stubborn.

213
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,730
I gotta make some tweaks.

214
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,390
Hop out.

215
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,330
Skip me, is it?

216
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,450
You can turn the fuel on.

217
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:35,630
That's right.

218
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,230
Just tighten the intake, that ought to do it.

219
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,070
How about it?

220
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:41,750
Yeah.

221
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,410
We found them!

222
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,210
They found us.

223
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,410
All right, give us some time to get down that runway.

224
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,510
You got it.

225
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,860
Look at me.

226
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,780
I'll see you soon, all right?

227
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,720
I promise.

228
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,940
Get the gun.

229
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:32,600
Oh no.

230
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,220
Go.

231
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,300
No, go!

232
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,900
Help me move this!

233
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:56,700
Are we good?

234
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:00,850
Yeah.

235
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,590
Yeah, we're good.

236
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,760
Shit.

237
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,350
Come on, come on, come on.

238
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,280
Suck it, motherfucker!

239
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,390
I had it.

240
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:09,770
Yeah, I know.

241
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,230
They say they'll be here by sundown.

242
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,030
We can head out in the morning.

243
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,290
Who are these people?

244
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,990
A couple I met at the demi-monde.

245
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,730
They can help us get to England.

246
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,970
From there, you may find a way across to America.

247
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,430
They speak English?

248
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,030
They're from Scotland, so...

249
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,290
No.

250
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,320
It's overheating.

251
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,980
Like a stove.

252
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,380
If only we had air conditioners.

253
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,500
It's better in England.

254
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,800
No, no.

255
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,960
I went to London when I was a kid.

256
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,040
The food is awful.

257
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,060
Confirmed.

258
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,640
You can come, you know.

259
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,020
I don't know.

260
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,600
I like Paris.

261
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:34,920
I don't know.

262
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,400
I don't know.

263
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,000
There's something special going on here.

264
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,020
And I hope to find Jamy again.

265
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,700
Good luck.

266
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,040
Hey, pal.

267
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,300
Maybe your pals could stop pointing those things at us.

268
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:55,380
Oh!

269
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,720
This is Fiona and Angus.

270
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,960
They will be our guides to the islands.

271
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,260
This is...

272
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,840
Daryl, Codron, Carol and Akira.

273
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,020
Hiya.

274
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,520
Nice to meet yous.

275
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,320
Some supplies to get through the checkpoint.

276
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,720
Supplies.

277
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,700
Wine.

278
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:28,980
A bit of food.

279
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,440
Very good.

280
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,040
Aye, that should be plenty.

281
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,140
At least one more than we need.

282
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:35,700
Oh.

283
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,880
We were in Edinburgh for a few years.

284
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,080
And Fiona said,

285
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,480
to hell with it.

286
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,580
Let's get hitched.

287
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,960
I thought that Paris would be romantic, you know.

288
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,160
We were young.

289
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,420
Young and dumb.

290
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,960
You know, I always had this dream about France.

291
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,620
The history, the culture, the food, you know.

292
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,560
What was it really like?

293
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,240
Before the world turned to shite.

294
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,780
My France.

295
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,100
Perfect.

296
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,000
Well, most of the time.

297
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,960
Of course, some things were not always so good.

298
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,380
I had these neighbours,

299
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,640
Desjardins, the White family.

300
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,940
They were not so nice.

301
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,060
My food smelled bad.

302
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,560
I played music too loud.

303
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,260
I worked in a hospital back then.

304
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,640
So, I came and went at all hours.

305
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,600
They complained about it.

306
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,800
And Monsieur Desjardins,

307
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,540
he lost his job.

308
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,500
Drank a lot.

309
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,380
Started calling me names.

310
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,640
Terrible words.

311
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,000
Tell me I should go and live in that good door.

312
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,680
With my people.

313
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,200
Then, boom.

314
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,300
The world changed.

315
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,820
We stayed in our flat.

316
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,840
Hoping to hold out.

317
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,720
Wait for this terrible thing to pass.

318
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,020
One night, I hear a knock at my door.

319
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,180
I grab my weapon and look out.

320
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:11,880
It's him.

321
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,300
Holding his two-year-old child.

322
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,960
Limp in his arms.

323
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,900
Pleading his eyes for me to help.

324
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,580
He thinks she's dead, but no.

325
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,380
Her airway was blocked.

326
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,780
And she passed out.

327
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,920
I got her breathing again.

328
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,860
She smiled at me.

329
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,000
And the father?

330
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,880
I took her and left.

331
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,960
But I saw gratitude in his eyes.

332
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,640
So,

333
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,680
the apocalypse put an end to racism?

334
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,680
Well, maybe it leveled the field.

335
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,720
A tiny bit.

336
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,680
Only two kinds of people now.

337
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:00,700
The dead

338
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,420
and the living.

339
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,140
We need more wood.

340
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,080
Wait, I'll come with you.

341
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,220
Okay.

342
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,700
Night-night.

343
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:16,760
Night.

344
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,980
Your story saddened me.

345
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,660
When the girl survived.

346
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,780
What happened next?

347
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,060
Well,

348
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,780
the family moved out.

349
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:40,880
And

350
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,420
I used the furniture to make wood.

351
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,240
It kept me warm all winter.

352
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,010
Goodbye then.

353
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,250
Tomorrow I'll be too shy.

354
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,110
Come back with us.

355
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,920
Forget Jamila.

356
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,250
Let's say goodbye again.

357
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,950
I'm sorry about what happened

358
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,030
to the nun.

359
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,010
She's probably in a better place now.

360
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,460
Like my brother.

361
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,040
His name was Michel.

362
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:30,980
It's a

363
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,860
very old name

364
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,760
in France.

365
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,260
I used to

366
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,400
laugh about that with him.

367
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,840
He hated that.

368
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,420
It was so hard to see him that way.

369
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,660
Having to

370
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,440
finish him off.

371
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,420
In a way, you

372
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,780
you put an end to a part of yourself.

373
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:11,670
Yeah, I can imagine.

374
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,450
You never told me what happened

375
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,170
when you killed Michel.

376
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,210
I didn't kill him.

377
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,330
That girl beat me to it.

378
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,670
What?

379
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:34,870
What girl?

380
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,370
A skinny girl on the road.

381
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,750
She was with some old guy who

382
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,510
tricked me into thinking he was blind.

383
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,280
She told me it was you.

384
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,520
What did you expect her to tell you?

385
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:57,950
So what?

386
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,770
Everything starting down in Marseille.

387
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,170
The abbey.

388
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,570
The mother's house.

389
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,050
The nun.

390
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,570
The things I did.

391
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,880
All of that just because of her.

392
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,960
I guess she was a pretty good liar.

393
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:30,850
You alright?

394
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,580
They should be there by now.

395
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,500
Ezekiel's probably showing Ash around.

396
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,170
Maybe Judith is trying to teach Florent

397
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,350
how to use her katana.

398
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,770
It wasn't easy there.

399
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,620
Never felt like home.

400
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,200
It'll be different this time.

401
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,700
We'll stay together.

402
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:05,150
I can't remember her face.

403
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,580
All I see

404
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,520
is of her after at the farm.

405
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,660
It was her before.

406
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,320
That little girl that I would read stories to.

407
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,340
Sing with and laugh with.

408
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,720
Time took that Sophia away.

409
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,260
All that's left is what came out of the barn.

410
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,320
It's more than that.

411
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,580
It just seems that way.

412
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,260
I'm tired, you know.

413
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:55,790
It's been so long,

414
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,550
it all just got churned up again.

415
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:57,990
Her.

416
00:38:59,130 --> 00:38:59,930
Lizzie.

417
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,630
Henry.

418
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,250
Hey.

419
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,050
None of that's your fault.

420
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:09,990
Come here.

421
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,370
Come here.

422
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,730
We keep going.

423
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,030
Alright?

424
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,210
That's what we do.

425
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,840
So that's it, huh?

426
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,560
A bit worse for wear,

427
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,100
but we can still get through.

428
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,360
Wow.

429
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,120
The tunnel.

430
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,080
50 kilometers downwind.

431
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,080
Took us about nine hours to walk this on the way here.

432
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,860
Take care.

433
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,740
You too.

434
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,450
We'll all be here thinking of you guys.

435
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:28,840
Let's go.

436
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:54,130
I know you regret where you are going.

437
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:56,590
You're not coming?

438
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,010
I have a reason to stay now.

439
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,690
I didn't warn you.

440
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,570
It's been a privilege fighting with you guys.

441
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,130
Thank you for everything.

442
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,680
Brothers in arms forever.

443
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,410
What did he say?

444
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,910
He said you're brothers in arms.

445
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,030
That's what I thought he said.

446
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,290
Your French is getting better.

447
00:41:50,290 --> 00:42:41,630
So what's England like?

448
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:43,650
England's shite.

449
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,170
Not bad, huh?

450
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:49,090
Actually, army took over and got things locked down pretty quick.

451
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,910
The island was good when we left.

452
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,030
Aye, but they're still English, so they're shite.

453
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,430
Now Scotland, there's a wet fucking dream.

454
00:42:59,010 --> 00:42:59,990
What the hell is that?

455
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:00,950
Guano.

456
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,250
Guano?

457
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:03,630
That shit.

458
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:04,970
Don't touch it.

459
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:06,770
Don't worry.

460
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:08,390
It's...

461
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:10,990
That stuff's psychoactive.

462
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,110
You're under the channel now.

463
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,470
Well, it does feel in holes.

464
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,530
Drowning's not anything I had on my to-do list.

465
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,050
Don't worry.

466
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,750
Pressure will crush you to death before you get your hair wet.

467
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:27,830
That's comforting, thank you.

468
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,530
How do we know how far we've gone?

469
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:32,650
That yellow door leads to a service tunnel.

470
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,210
There's one every half kilometre.

471
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:35,690
Only 91 to go.

472
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:36,730
Now hold up.

473
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,500
That must be a checkpoint.

474
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,620
English? Why so close to France?

475
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,260
To keep out the fucking French.

476
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,300
Hey, relax, mate.

477
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,240
Just keep your guns away.

478
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,940
Let me do the talking.

479
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:52,900
You'll just piss them off.

480
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:03,880
Hello?

481
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,050
We're British.

482
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,170
Please don't shoot.

483
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,250
We come bearing gifts.

484
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:13,590
Angus, get it.

485
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:18,810
Vino!

486
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,390
We've got Vino!

487
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,070
God save the Queen!

488
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,220
I guess they're not gonna be needing a wine.

489
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,460
Not for us.

490
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,910
And God said,

491
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:23,470
let there be...

492
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,300
They killed each other.

493
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,610
Why would they do that?

494
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:42,190
Maybe it's the guano.

495
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,750
If you breathe it in too long, you can start to see things.

496
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,230
Start getting you paranoid.

497
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:49,910
They'll lose their minds.

498
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:00,530
Let's keep moving.

499
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:37,070
What is this?

500
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:39,510
Bioluminescence.

501
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:43,310
Some animals and plants generate their own light.

502
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:46,270
Like fireflies.

503
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:47,350
Yeah.

504
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:48,910
Exactly.

505
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:52,720
Walker.

506
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,030
All right, follow me.

507
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:02,090
Single file.

508
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:03,350
Keep quiet.

509
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,900
You OK?

510
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,400
Don't worry about me, Froggy.

511
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,420
It's OK.

512
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:03,900
You all right?

513
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,940
Where's Carol?

514
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,060
You killed my brother!

515
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,040
Stop!

516
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,320
Stop!

517
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:25,900
It's me.

518
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,300
Stop!

519
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,700
Fiché!

520
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,380
Fiché!

521
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,440
Fiché!

522
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:12,310
Hey, mate.

523
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,210
Here, put it on.

524
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:06,140
There you are.

525
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:12,830
Sorry, pal.

526
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:14,630
There's not enough masks for the lot of us.

527
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:17,570
We've got people waiting for us back home, mate.

528
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:21,490
You can't just leave them here.

529
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:44,380
This has been so long.

530
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:09,050
I could come with you.

531
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:55,900
Where's my pistol?

532
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,240
Where's my pistol and my bag?

533
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,800
Where's your bag?

534
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,220
I'll give it to her, eh?

535
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,060
You think you've had enough?

536
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:11,990
That there's nothing left inside you?

537
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:15,370
You think it's over?

538
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:19,150
But you won't die here.

539
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,160
Not like him.

540
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:53,530
Remember when we first met?

541
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:55,410
What I told you.

542
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:56,570
Good luck, Mr. Dixon.

543
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:41,080
TO BE CONTINUED...
